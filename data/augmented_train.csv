""" Ongoing IAU discussion? Is the reason that there was no improved IAU definition of planets that they wanted to pass such a decision with a large majority, but couldn't come to an agreement yet? I hope it's not that they think the current definitions are OK, because they're clearly not. For example the definition of extrasolar planet states the lower mass limit for an object to be an extrasolar planet is the same as in the Solar System... but there was no such limit given. Neither for dwarf planets nor for regular planets. There would have been no harm done if the upper limit for extrasolar planets was also applied to the Solar System, but that wasn't done either. It's like they're hiding everything behind smoke and mirrors and make up the results as they go. It would be relatively easy to come up with criteria that could decide if a newly discovered body is a planet or not. But they didn't do it. Why? What for example is wrong with the following? 1. A planetary mass object is an object with a mass between the agreed mass limit needed for hydrostatic equilibrium (5×1020kg) and the agreed mass limit needed for deuterium fusion (2.5×1028kg). (Both limits might be set lower since the first would exclude Pallas and Vesta which are remaining protoplanets and the second doesn't take into account that objects with high metallicity could allow deuterium fusion at a lower mass) 2. A planet is a planetary mass object on an orbit around at least one star that also has the capability of clearing its orbit (per Stern-Levison criteria. The difference is you only need to know mass and orbital period of the object (and the star of course), whereas with Soter's criteria you'd need to know everything about the system). 3. A dwarf planet (I prefer mesoplanet) is a planetary mass object on an orbit around at least one star that doesn't fulfill the Stern-Levison criteria. More definitions could be added to account for other types of planetary mass objects. I prefer """"planetar"""" for those that don't orbit any star - regardless if they were formed by themselves or in a system of which they were later ejected. Also, I'd like """"moon"""" to mean a planetary mass object that orbits a planet (since the prototype object Luna is just that) - smaller bodies would just keep being """"satellites"""". (If you don't like to have 60 planets of which most are small, why would you allow 60 moons of which most are tiny?) Any ideas why the IAU doesn't come up with something like that? First of all, there is a lower mass limit: hydrostatic equilibrium. Second, this has nothing to do with improving the article. Simply talking about the merits or lack thereof of the IAU's decision is outside the scope of Wikipedia. podous Your second point is right. My opinions are not relevant, as I'm not an astronomer, and my conclusions from the available data would be OR, so neither belongs in the article. But you don't seem to realize that your first point is extremely open to definition. It could mean the shape of the object. Then the next question is where the limit between spheroidal and irregular is. It could mean an object with this mass and composition would certainly reach hydrostatic equilibrium. Or it could mean an object with this mass would certainly reach hydrostatic equilibrium. I'm heavily in favour of the third, as it is the one that could be most easily checked (especially for exoplanets), and avoids the problem that an ice world could qualify, while a larger and denser asteroid would be rejected, since rocky worlds are much harder to pull into equilibrium. But from statements in the article, I'm guessing at least those astronomers favor the second one. (And if they're not representative, why would they be in the article?)Basically, I want to say that the IAU should make a decision that makes it clear the astronomers know what they are doing and want to share their knowledge with the public. Because if the public decides to not follow astronomers' findings anymore, the result will likely be even less funding... and that would be a real problem. There are many ambiguities with the current definition, all of which are mentioned in the article already. podous 13:29, 19 Januar",0,0,0,0,0,0

Although ethnic designations like Boeotian, Macedonian, Syrian, Arab and Jew probably refer to geographic origin, """"Persian"""" proves problematic. Its precise origin or significance is disputed. In the early Ptolemaic period it seems to describe people with Greek names functioning in a Greek context; although they enjoy a privileged status, they are counted separately from Greeks in tax lists.

"Roazir; Fars is the Arabic version of Pars, the Iranian name when translated to English is “the Gulf of Pars” and the English name “Persian Gulf” means exactly the same thing, Interestingly enough most Gulfs in the world are called like the Iranian name for e.g. Gulf of Mexico, Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Carpentaria, Gulf of the Farallones, Gulf of Maine, Gulf of Tonkin, Gulf of Guinea, etc, etc, so the correct name for the Persian Gulf should have been “the Gulf Of Pars” just as the Iranian name is! As for the Azarbaijan, as both versions already exist on the Wiki and we are not inventing a new name, I insist on using the one that is recognised by the majority of the people in the region. The whole population of Rep Azerbaijan is less than 10% of the population of Iran (let alone other countries in the region who write and pronounce the word Azarbaijan like Iranians do) so why a vast majority should follow a small minority? It is Azarbaijan and English speaking people better get used to it!",0,0,0,0,0,0

""" ... Thanks for the quick response Khoikhoi. I was quite impressed with how level headed your second reply to me was (you didn't immediately go into a defensive ego trip like some others I've bumped into. Very much appreciated. A rare quality ). I will take your advice and will refrain from doing such edits temporarily. If possible though I still would like a little more clarification on the matter before I make any final decision on the matter. While there are occasional exceptions, a visit to virtually any article on any city in the world (new or old) doesn't show the pattern of a long list of multiple old not in use historically insignificant foreign names on the first line. For instance FYROM/Republic of Macedonia's title lists Macedonian: Скопје, pronounced [ˈskopje], Albanian: Shkup, or Shkupi)[1] (their two largest demographics). There is no mention of older Turkish and ancient Greek pronouncement for Skopje). So it seems very fishy to me that obscure Greek islands are seemingly being prioritized with old Turkish occupation names over major cities. Also I would like to note the Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names) specifically states """"The title can be followed in the first line by a list of alternative names"""" (i.e. not """"must"""" be) It further clarifies the point (with regards to use of older historical foreign names on the first line)... Relevant foreign language names (one used by at least 10% of sources in the English language or is used by a group of people which used to inhabit this geographical place) are permitted and should be listed in alphabetic order of their respective languages, i.e., (Armenian name1, Belarusian name2, Czech name3). or (ar: name1, be: name2, cs: name3). Unless you can demonstrate that these obscure alternate foreign language name qualify as """"Relevant foreign language names used by at least 10% of sources in the English language or used by a group of people which used to inhabit the geographic place""""... I don't believe an obscure set of Greek islands remotely qualifies for this rule of prominent display. And this point of sensitivity to names is further clarified at the head of the geographic naming convention article where it explicitly states... Historical names or names in other languages can be used in the lead if they are frequently used and important enough to be valuable to readers, and should be used in articles with caution. Notice the words """"and should be used in articles with caution"""". I think it's pretty clear that the Balkans are an extremely sensitive area with regards to names. (it stirs the pot for old ethnic conflicts) I think perhaps you've misunderstood my motivations here a bit. The issue for me wasn't whether the names could be mentioned (they obviously always should be in there somewhere)... but exactly where in the article they are mentioned. Unless it is historically important (e.g. Constantinople) any mention of older historical Turkish or Greek occupation names should only be added later in the article in a historical or etymological context.... not be given equal airplay upfront with current names or historically unimportant names. Doing so is both bulky and highly provocative to sensitive political regions. (and incidentally the same rule should apply for inappropriately using historically insignificant Greek names for Turkish cities) I'm sticking to my guns that my edits were kosher according to existing Wikipedia geographic naming conventions and current widely observable conventions. I'd even go further and suggest leaving those old historically insignificant foreign names prominently displayed is far more disruptive than removing them (both in a Wikipedia sense and in a human toll sense) I therefore would like to once again remove those old names from the first paragraph but will delay pending your response to me (to confirm I have (or have not) convinced you of the accuracy of my assertions) Thanks in advance for all your help.

Perhaps there should be an entry on people whose vision prevents them from correctly judging people's heights or reading a measuring tape. Junior? With a few web searches I couldn't turn up any reference to his birth name including a Jr. that seemed to be independent of and more reliable than Wikipedia. Also, in his autobiography he says his father's name is Ray, and the genealogy link someone has in this discussion page says it's Ray D. Norris. Also, his father being Carlos and he being Jr. is inconsistent with him being named after his minister, which he also says in his autobiography. So I changed it. Also, both the cited NYT article and his book spell his brother's name Wieland. Birth date issue? Astrodatabank.com quotes his autobiography for March 10, 1942?? Can someone source the 1940 date? Family man quote is too strong Under Personal Life, after detailing how he had a child out of wedlock the following quote shows up: """"Norris has always been a very loving family man"""" Which uses a People magazine article of him hugging his adult sons as evidence. This seems to be pretty weak evidence for this assertion. Fisrt, please use the four tilde thing ~~~~ to sign your posts. It's easier to refer to someone when there's a someone to refer to. Second, I'm not sure what is the problem. Are you saying that having children out of wedlock demeans the """"family man"""" comment? Or that hugging his son is not enough proof? I'm not sure the picture is there to provide proof for the statement (that would be OR and should be eliminated if that's the case).

Also, remember that this is a page about Nancy Pelosi and not about Turkey and and the Armenian Genocide. """"give opportunity for the other side to justify why Pelosi is wrong on this issue""""? This is not the POV by Nancy Pelosi or US House of Representatives Committee, but a tragic event recognized by the most of democratic societies and countries.

YOu are an armenianorigin person. Andranik indeed has been one ot he heads of the bloody Armenian militia killing Turks, Kurds and Azeris, with his terrorist acts has been the reason for the reaction of Kurds, Turks and Azeris after they returned from the war in 5 fronts. So your response is absolutly biased, because of your nationality and firm belief in an event that never occured or occurded only for the Armenian church who uses this so called armenian genocide to mobilzie armenians and prevent their assimilation. As to the fact this is not the page for the other side, this shows how much you are anti-democratic and biased on this issue. This is against the Wikip3edia neturality principle as well.

Also, as I think can be seen, the Human potential movement which Landmark is generally a part of is counted as a new religious movement, whose name strongly implies """"religious"""" nature but only implicitly, and in fact est is listed in the List of new religious movements I helped put together based on the articles contained in encyclopedic sources on NRMs I found.

In response to if you have any sources available to help improve the article, or which might be useful in determining which article we should use as the primary article on this topic area, any input would be more than welcome. So far as I can tell, Landmark has pretty much said that they were initially using the est approach, although they have admitted to changing it subsequently (I'm not sure how much, or if they've ever specifically indicated in what ways). So it might be that something like Landmark Forum or some similar title might be the best main article for the topic of the seminars as a whole, with specific information on the various groups and companies related to it in articles on those topics.

First, thank you for your contribution; Wikipedia relies solely on the efforts of volunteers such as you. Unfortunately, the page you created covers a topic on which we already have a page - Sino-Indian relations. Because of the duplication, your article has been tagged for speedy deletion. Please note that this is not a comment on you personally and we hope you will continue helping to improve Wikipedia. If the topic of the article you created is one that interests you, then perhaps you would like to help out at Sino-Indian relations - you might like to discuss new information at the article's talk page. If you think that the article you created should remain separate, contest the deletion by clicking on the button labelled """"Click here to contest this speedy deletion,"""" which appears inside of the speedy deletion ({{db-...}}) tag (if no such tag exists, the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate). Doing so will take you to the talk page where you will find a pre-formatted place for you to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. You can also visit the the page's talk page directly to give your reasons, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. If the page is deleted, you can contact one of these administrators to request that the administrator userfy the page or email a copy to you. Additionally if you would like to have someone review articles you create before they go live so they are not nominated for deletion shortly after you post them, allow me to suggest the article creation process and using our search feature to find related information we already have in the encyclopedia.

"""=Unbalanced critique=== The psychotherapy article needs a balanced critique section. The current article contains a section called """"criticisms and questions regarding effectiveness"""" in which a few random studies have been cited, and a laundry list of random arguments are put forward. It is not a comprehensive precis of the effectiveness literature. The article neglects a wide body of work that points to a) the success of some types of therapy with specific types of disorders, b) discipline-agnostic characteristics of therapist behaviour that contribute to success, c) superiority of psychopharmacology & psychotherapy combined, vs either intervention on it's own, d) characteristics of clients/patients that seem to benefit most from psychotherapy, and e) vested interests of stakeholders in swinging research to one side of the debate or the other and other inhibiting factors - consider the two APA's, the various laws and licensing authorities, the separate academic communities in psychiatry, philosophy, social work, occupational therapy, the professional jealousies, the profound neglect of mental illness and psychological wellbeing in public health and health insurance, and the impact of the pharmaceutical industry's deep pockets on the dominant discourse. Please note that I am editing anonymously in protest against the tyrrany of the editing majority. Wikipedia's non-negotiable, amateur editor norm might be appropriate for certain article categories, but in more nuanced technical spaces there is invariably a segment that make nuisances of themselves by wanting to debate every word and angle. I have watched the development of articles on schools of psychotherapy since the early 2000s, and I'm afraid time and multiple amateur edits have not improved them much. In the specific case of psychology their mistakes add to the perception that this is a wishy washy discipline void of a body of knowledge and ANY facts. I suspect that this is partly why self-respecting people who are knowledgeable don't want to be involved in what is otherwise a very worthy undertaking. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 41.242.118.144 ==""",0,0,0,0,0,0

""" Disruptive edits? No - only correcting a falsehood re-inserted by the perpetrator, who took liberties with the """"consensus"""" decision that he was wildly off base. Even in a footnote, his original research that islands in the Fraser River are """"not actually part of the continuous mainland"""" is fictitious and constitute digging in his heels on his position; I simply corrected his (ongoing) error and mis-use of language; he wants to mention the City of Richmond, not its main island (Lulu Island, which also includes about 1/3 of the City of New Westminster, namely Queensborough), yet his """"footnote"""" spoke of Richmond as an island. I'm not the one making the disruptive edits. Franamax, who's familiar with the area, also concurs about the notion that freshwater islands are obviously part of the mainland and distinct from offshore islands such as Bowen; and that same footnote also re-digs in the false notion that dictionary definitions have anything to do with the meaning of the name. The RfC accomplished nothing, except the consensus refutation of any validity to his position, and rile my back up over something wildly silly in nature for no good reason; and the RfC closed, with the consensus that JimWae's position was wrong, but a footnote explaining , not asserting. JimWae simply went ahead and reinserted his original problem-content as if it were all peachy keen and he had won. But he didn't even get the English idiom """"contiguous mainland"""" correct, I corrected that; he also wanted to centre on the City of Richmond even though that's not, in and of itself, an island (it's about 20); I simply pointed out the absurdity of what he had added by adding other things that didn't fit the dictionary definitions attached to """"lower"""" and """"mainland"""". If you give as license to absurdity, or tolerate it, then you have to tolerate absurdities ensuant on it with impartiality. Rivers and lakes are not land, but they are part of """"the mainland"""", mountain peaks are not """"lower"""", but they are part of the Lower Mainland. So either the RfC stands - with JimWae's assertions being dismissed as original research - or you are enforcing a selective interpretation of it forbidding anyone from altering what JimWae wants to add, even though his addition was not supported by the RfC. *A* footnote was tolerated by the RfC, or suggested by it. But nobody said """"let JimWae say whatever he wants so long as it's in footnote form"""". And if he uses incorrect language/idiom, then anyone (including me) can correct it - the City of Richmond is not an island, and the expression """"continuous mainland"""" is not the correct English idiom for what he thinks he's saying. It's that simple. You're welcome to reverse the consequent absurdities I've added; but if you do, and leave JimWae's false and original research as it is, then you have gone against the consensus of the RfC.....Lulu Island is in the Fraser River, not Georgia Strait, it's that simple; and the river is on the mainland, so what's in it is on the mainland.....if that needs to be explained in a footnote, it doesn't need to be explained in the way that JimWae put it; which was, again, simply his re-iteration of his original erroneous and original-research interpretation.....

""":Let me first of all set the record straight about the history of the relationship between myself and User:Jza84. On his talk page Jza84 states 'I hardly know the editor bar an passing in a discussion from time to time'. As Mangojuice notes on that same page, 'Jza clearly knows Enaidmawr is a long-time established editor here; Jza interacted with Enaidmawr as early as November 2007, over 6 months before Jza became an admin.' That interaction was courteous and constructive and repeated on a number of occasions. I wouldn't claim that we were regular collaborators, but collaborate we did, and if somebody had aske me, before this incident, 'do you know this editor and do you have a good working relationship with him?' I would have replied in the affirmative, without hesitation. The only real """"edit conflict"""" I had with him prior to this was in February of this year, at British Day. This was resolved civilly and without rancour, although I have to admit that I found his attitude at the time patronising - """"A lesson would be it took all of five minutes to strengthen the article up with a few references."""" - and felt that the zealousy with which he reacted to my edits - an effort to bring balance to a biased account, in my opinion, for what it's worth - whilst ignoring a number of dubious and unsourced statements and peacock terms for the opposing view of the subject, was unbalanced. However, I refrained from comment (see Brit Day in his talk page archive). 'Everybody is entitled to their views', I said to myself, and moved on. I'll admit that I tended to avoid him after that as I had no wish to get embroiled in anything: I've got better things to do. I could have responded to this comment on Talk:Newport which I found to be deeply insulting to all Welsh people: saying that Daicaregos was 'an advocate of """"Welsh nationality"""" (which doesn't exist, verifiabily)(). That statement left me with the indelible impression that Jza84 denied the nationality of myself and all Welsh people. I thought that was a very hurtful comment and completely unnecessary and I am sure that most Welsh people would feel the same way. However, once again I did not respond even though I was part of that discussion and was sorely tempted to do so: 'Ignore it', I told myself. Shortly later I became aware of a series of edits by Jza84 removing Welsh nationality and replacing it with 'British' on a number of articles on my watchlist; amongst them was the article on Dafydd Wigley, Plaid Cymru's senior statesman. Rightly or wrongly, I was by then convinced that Jza84 had a personal agenda on this matter. I reverted some edits and ignored others not on my watchlist as I genuinely did not want to get involved in a dispute (and no, it had nothing to do with his admin status). However, when I saw his edit to Template:Welsh kingdoms, also on my watchlist, I will admit that I was incensed. I reacted with less tact than I should have done, I admit. I reverted his edit. Changing 'Welsh kingdoms' to the woefully incorrect and insulting 'Brittonic petty kingdoms of Wales' seemed to me to confirm my impression of him: it basically de-Cymricised the major kingdoms of medieval Wales, which have a central place in our history and identity, used a term which is both incorrect and open to misinterpretation by the general reader (not everyone is aware of the meaning of the rather obsolete and affected term 'petty kingdom'). He than undid my edit and came up with the wording 'Ancient kingdoms of Wales', which is again quite simply incorrect ('medieval' is not 'ancient'). Then I read his """"explanation"""" on the talk page. Quite frankly I thought he was taking the mickey. It also confirmed me in my opinion that he had an agenda of denying the Welsh people their identity (quote: 'What exactly are the Welsh kingdoms? Kingdoms inhabited by the Welsh? Well, no, the Welsh are a modern nation who live in Wales. Are they subdivisions of Wales? Well, also no, these kingdoms pre-date Wales by centuries (Wales was a concept of the future!'). 'What fools historians, Welsh and others, have been to refer to such icons of Welsh history as Llywelyn the Great as Welsh (and his court poets who praised him as 'King of the Welsh' etc.)', I said to myself. At that point I should have taken a deep breath and walked away to make a coffee, count to several thousand and then respond. But I did not, and the result is this. That sets the record straight. I've already apologised for any offense I may have caused and given my opinion of Jza84's decision. I write this to let my peers who have commented and acted on the matter get the 'history' behind this incident from my point of view. I do not intend to respond here to other things which have been said or implied here and at Jza84's page about",0,0,0,0,0,0

""" I would think the problem is that egg-rolls and spring rolls are clearly two different things but the numbers of differences can very. On the main egg-roll article, there is a citation that links to an article written by no less of an authority than Chinese-American chef Martin Yan. There Yan details the main difference between the two. Egg-rolls have eggs as part of the wrapper, along with wheat flour and water. Spring rolls just have the wheat flour and water. This one ingredient different causes several changes. The inclusion of the eggs causes egg-rolls to be darker, slightly chewer and with a rougher outer texture. Spring rolls, with the lack of egg, fry up slightly crispier with a lighter color and a smoother outer texture. All of this is directly from Chef Yan, not myself, so it can be taken as authoritative. And all that is clear enough. The problem or confusion if you will, most often centers around the filling and the size. At this point, we mostly have personal experience. Your average Chinese restaurant in America is bound to have a dish called an egg-roll. This egg roll is going to have the wrapper made from egg, wheat flour and water. It will be filled with assorted vegetables and a protein. The protein can be shrimp, pork, chicken or a combination of shrimp and pork. The differences in the protein are often regional, with some areas only having shrimp and/or pork while other areas only having chicken. The size can also be different as well depending on how thick or thin the cook rolls the egg-roll out. I've seen egg-rolls thicker than manicotti or as thin as spring rolls. The only thing uniform is the color and texture as the effects of the egg in the wrapper are consistent. In addition it might be worth mentioned that egg-rolls are a far more common sight than spring rolls on the menus of such restaurants but that might be somewhat off-topic. We could say, as Mr. Colin McLarty writes above, that another key difference is that many consider egg-rolls as having meat (protein) with vegetables as a filling, while spring rolls only have vegetables. And to be sure, I have never seen spring rolls anywhere in the US with any protein in the filing. And when you order a egg-roll in a Americanized Chinese restaurant, it will contain some sport of protein. However, one can find a curious thing in the frozen foods section of America supermarkets everywhere throughout the country. Vegetable egg-rolls. They are not spring rolls as they are made with the wrapper that contains egg and from the outside they look just like the egg-rolls that are sold right next to them. But yet while you can find them in supermarkets coast-to-coast, I personally have yet to see them in any Chinese restaurant. Of course, all of this does not touch upon the tendency of Vietnamese restaurants in the US to call Goi cuon """"spring rolls"""". One can only assume such a decision is to make an ethic menu, without a typical spring roll on it, more appealing non-Asian customers. Though some restaurants do call Goi cuon """"summer rolls"""" instead. And I once personally saw a menu for a Thai restaurant that had both typical egg-rolls and typical spring rolls but also offered Goi cuon as well, labeling it as the """"house spring roll""""!

I can only assume you looked at the later edit to Didier Zokora which was not obviously that offensive to me at least. Thanks I am also a little confused. I agree that there is a fine line in dealing with personal attacks. I simply would like this line pointed out so that we will know how to deal with it in the future. Thanks, Well, I think it's down to individual discretion; blocks are preventive, so if the IP is unlikely to commit another similar edit in the next ten minutes or so it'd be somewhat redundant.

""":::::From the diffeology article: """"Differentiable manifolds also generalize smoothness. They are normally defined as topological manifolds with an atlas, whose transition maps are smooth, which is used to pull back the differential structure"""" (emphasis mine). The point is not whether differentiable manifolds can be defined without an atlas (I already pointed out that they can also be defined with sheaves), but that the classical definition that most mathematicians are still using is the atlas definition. Markus is correct that the choice of an atlas for a topological manifold doesn't matter, but to be a manifold I will contend that it must have some atlas. Defining the sphere as a set of zeroes is implicitly embedding the sphere into another space. It has already been pointed out several times that a topological sphere does not have a unique differentiable manifold structure. How is the differentiable manifold structure induced by the embedding, and (more to the point) how can one understand the corresponding differentiable manifold structure on a topological sphere without mentioning this embedding? Topological spaces are not equipped with embeddings a priori. That a sphere with a differentiable manifold structure has a topological embedding into euclidean space does not at all imply that the differentiable structure was induced by this embedding. - """,0,0,0,0,0,0

We discussed it here, and when the discussion ended, without any result, I removed the civility warning from my talk page, because I use to archive / remove old conversations in my talk page. Automatically, wen you saw I had removed the civility warning, you blocked me for a 24 hour period. Your block was absolutely illegitimate, for various reasons: The way you did it: The reason you gave to block me was: """"Yes, I've seen the comment on your talk page.

In addition, by not communicating me that I was blocked, you did not allow me to ask other admins to review my block. The reasons why you did it: It is not stated anywhere in this Wikipedia that an user cannot remove stuff from his talk page. You neither told me not to remove that stuff. I accepted and fulfilled your request of having a civil attitude. Ignoring what I had done before (which was not much), since the moment you told me that, I kept a civil attitude. I also lost my time coming here to reply you, so there is no possible way to say that I ignored your request. In all, your block was just full of irregularities. It was not a normal admin block, but rather a thoughtless decission that you took without following any kind of procedure. You just decided that I had to be blocked because you might think that removing the civility warning that you had posted in my talk page was some kind of lack of respect towards you. But it is frankly stupid to think that way, because of the reasons I've explained above. And since you realized that you had comitted an enormous mistake, that you had used your admin powers despotically, you just repeatedly ignored the requests that I did to you in your own talk page, where I asked you why had you blocked me (this one, and this one), adding to your unjustified attitude towards me, a high grade of arrogance. In addition, you are threatening me. Read well what I wrote: """"Hello? Why did you block me? Since when removing a civility warning from one's talk page is something that deserves a block?

""""If you do not wish to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, then we shall make sure that you do not prevent others from contributing"""" ... oh, """"we"""". This sounds to me more like a street gang threatening a poor pedestrian, than an admin giving wise advices to a poor Wikipedian. Go to my user page and see the articles I've created. Isn't that a positive contribution? Look: I am not being uncivil; it is you, the one being disrespectful with me. And I am not ignoring your requests of being civil; I am fulfilling them.

Why would he delete this post, I wonder: If anyone is curious, in the interests of creating a NPOV article about surrealism, it should be noticed that both user#63.169.104.2 and user#24.168.66.27 were the main users interested in pushing the Keith Wigdor article forward. If you have any doubts, then check the discussion page for that article. It wasn't long ago that all references to """"Keith Wigdor"""" were removed from this """"surrealism"""" article. This removal occured because of Wigdor's total unimportance to the surrealist movement, for the simple reason that Keith Wigdor is, at best, an emerging digital artist who fancies himself as a being a surrealist, and who has many times attempted to pose as a surrealist. Needless to say, many of the english-speaking surrealist groups listed on this page know about him and refuse to have anything to do with him. Keith Wigdor appears again and again to disrupt all things genuinely surrealist. It is also interesting to note, if you check the discussion archives of this """"surrealism"""" article, that these same 2 users were also involved with promoting Keith Wigdor as a surrealist, in this very article. Also, if you look at some of the recent, belligerent, trollish, thike-ish posts of these 2 users, it shouldn't be unreasonable to suspect that perhaps both of these 2 IP numbers are being used by Keith Wigdor. For the 2 no-name users mentioned here, who are strongly associated with or strongly correlated with the antics of Keith Wigdor, it is difficult to imagine that their efforts in building this wiki article will be anything but disruptive and manipulative in the long run. Please treat these 2 users with extreme caution, for they are one and the same, and also happen to be Keith Wigdor, who is playing a sock-puppet game. 22:10, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)""",0,0,0,0,0,0

"student uprising 1973 I don't have any research data exactly, but I am an American who was a US Navy dependent wife living in Athens when the Polytechnic uprising occurred. And since I was there, although not directly involved in the uprising (just got caught in some of the crossfire) my perspective is quite different from what has been presented on the pages. I would like to share with you what my experience was, and perhaps it could lead to some further illumination of what really happened during that month or 2. (It wasn't all over in 2-3 days, as the story indicates) And there were many more killed than the numbers listed, although I have no evidence of this. I personally saw beatings and shooting by police and army at the Polytechnic when I took a friend to deliver food to her brother who was a participant in the uprising. Her name was Litha and his was Vagellis. I no longer recall last names, but could probably find out from some old friends. She came to New York to attend college in the mid to late 1970s. The question that has always haunted me is why the US government totally ignored the entire situation in spite of the fact that the 6th fleet was anchored at Elyfsis and the AirForce base was fully manned and operational. The American press did not even report the uprising. As I was only 21 at the time, my parents watched carefully for some news of what I had written to them once mail service was restored, and only a short virtually nondescript article from UPS showed up buried in the back pages of the newspapers. It was never even mentioned on television here. I am still haunted by what I saw, and that was 32 years ago.

"Whistlersghost Pearl Buck illustrators Personally, I am aware of no precedents for including references to illustrators of works in the biography of the author. Such content could reasonably I think be added to the content in the bio of the illustrator, but from what little I know the author doesn't necessarily choose the illustrator, so there's not necessarily any real connection between the author per se and the illustrator. Having said all that, inclusion of such info in the articles on the books themselves makes perfect sense, and if it can be established that there was a degree of personal contact between an author and an illustrator, that could be referenced in the article too. But personally I can't see justifying the existing section in the article in question.

""": Recently a group of I.P. addresses were used in order to engage in vandalism, disruptive edits and nonsense edits against this article, in addition to engaging in harassing behavior, apparently due to ideological motivations. In the edit summary of your second edit of this article, you incorrectly state that """"Clearly there is some dispute about the accuracy and neutrality of this article. This tag should not be removed until this dispute is resolved."""" What there was was this group of I.P. addresses engaged in vandalism and other disruptive behavior, with one person (69.230.175.35, with possibly this same person using one or more of the other I.P. addresses) ending the """"dispute"""" with an act of vandalism in addition to the message """"You know what fuck off [some Anglo-Saxon name]. I want to see how much you can take before you crack."""" So in fact there had been no authentic """"dispute about the accuracy and neutrality of this article"""". The """"Omega Point (Tipler)"""" article is accurate in describing the Omega Point Theory, with thorough citations provided. The article follows Wikipedia policy of WP:NPOV, as the article does not claim that the Omega Point Theory is true, but instead is written in the neutral point of view: it describes the Omega Point Theory, but it does not claim that it is correct. The article uses neutral-point-of-view language, such as """"According to Tipler from a 2005 paper in the journal Reports on Progress in Physics, he outlines the following reasons why he maintains ..."""" In the edit summary of your first edit of this article, you state """"Obvious really, who the hell is repeatedly removing this categorisation?"""", referring to the """"Category:Pseudoscience"""" edit added by said person or persons engaged in vandalism, nonsense edits and disruptive edits. Your edit summary falsely makes it seem as if this edit has long been in the article, and that it has just recently been removed, which is incorrect. Your edit here also violates Wikipedia policy, such as WP:Truth and WP:NPOV. Prof. Frank J. Tipler's Omega Point Theory has been peer-reviewed and published in a number of the world's leading physics journals, and so under WP:Reliable Sources does not qualify as """"pseudoscience"""". Your phraseology of """"who the hell"""" also violates WP:Civility. You claim WP:Undue Weight for the latest factually-incorrect edits, yet almost the entirety of the peer-reviewed paers in science journals are in support of the Omega Point Theory. There has only been one refereed paper in a physics journal that was critical of Prof. Tipler's Omega Point Theory, but the authors of that paper unwittingly gave an argument that unless the Omega Point comes about then the laws of physics are violated, and so thereby actually gave a powerful argument for the Omega Point Theory's correctness. Tipler cites this article in support of his Omega Point Theory in his 2005 Reports on Progress in Physics article. Regarding critical reviews of Tipler's books, none of them have been refereed in science journals. They are book reviews that have not undergone the referee process that is required of actual papers. Prof. Tipler and his Omega Point Theory have been in the news recently. This has drawn the attention of ideologically-motivated people who upon hearing of it take an extreme visceral dislike to it. Because of this, this article and its associated talk page have recently been subject to vandalism and other disruptive behavior. Therefore, due to the foregoing reasons, you are here requested not to further engage in such factually-incorrect and Wikipedia-policy-violating edits. I will start a """"Criticisms"""" section which details the above information, but do not add factually-incorrect and Wikipedia-policy-violating tags to this article. """,0,0,0,0,0,0

For us, the philosophical basis of this concept was articulated by the science-fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon in his novel More Than Human, wherein the protagonists each have a single paranormal talent – telepathy, psychokinesis, teleportation – and are joined by a quadruple paraplegic who acts as a central processing unit.

I still am shocked to see that you guys are defending an anonymous kid's high school homework paper as a legitimate source of knowledge, to be honorably quoted on the Wikipedia. 2) Credible sources (like Encyclopaedia Britannica ) are saying that another religion is the oldest surviving religion. On the Wikipedia article on Hinduism, the exact same claim is made but with reliable sources (See WP:SOURCES): Among its direct roots is the historical Vedic religion of Iron Age India and, as such, Hinduism is often called the """"oldest living religion""""D. S. Sarma, Kenneth W. Morgan, The Religion of the Hindus, 1953 or the """"oldest living major religion"""" in the world.in the world. So, my question is: which page on the Wikipedia is to be trusted in this regard? The one with reliable scholarly sources or the one with anonymous self-published pdf files? I still do not understand why the name of the authors are not given and they are considered scholarly sources. Where were these cited works published? Where are the references in the works? These essays are saying """"God made a pact with Abraham..."""" and so forth. How can this be even taken seriously if the article is assuming that all the God pact story is actual historical fact? Any way, that's the besides the main point. The real issues here are reliable sources, self-published sources, verifiability and original research (by anonymous teenage prodigal scholars). Now let us examine the scholar """"noel12"""" from Texas who wrote this high school homework paper. On the cited source, the said scholar claims to be 15 at the time of writing this scholarly article. Do we still need to talk about WP:V in this regard? The other cited source (a music website run by Jewish people) does not even have a title or name of the author or date of publication or anything except the bold claim that Judaism is the oldest religion. Please do not take this personally or anything (I really wish to stress this twice); I just like to see Wikipedia as a reliable encyclopedia. Is it more about reflecting personal sentiments or providing credible knowledge, cited with scholarly sources? In summary, I say that the uncited claim of Judaism being the oldest surviving religion be removed, while keeping the oldest monotheistic religion part and keep Wikipedia a serious, unbiased encyclopedia. Hope I have appealed to your better judgement. 70.64.86.187 """,0,0,0,0,0,0

They once again proved themselfs to be the proven LIARS we alreayd knew they were since the article wrongly states that the darker picture with the """"fall-off"""" effects is the edited one, which is pure BS. The original photo is the one with the """"fall-off"""" effect which was printed in The West Australian already back in august 2, 1969 (~6 min in this clip http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMuTiziCszU) while the lighten up picture is the EDITED version who came out much later. So unless the propaganda trolls cant find a version of THEIR claimed original version dated EARLIER than august second 1969, i suggest them to SHUTUP.

The video shows a guy holding up the actual newspaper from 2 aug 1969 to prove that the """"fall-off"""" picture is how the original one looked like, but then its youtube who isnt a reliable source!? your desperate try for making a point is laughable... but i wouldnt expect more from a propaganda TROLL. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 91.145.38.53 No, that newspaper doesn't show what the original one looks like. The original is a transparency that is in NASA's vaults. They made prints that were widely reprinted. See this for more information. You talkin' to me? Bullshit! excuses from NASA wont make it true! you have the history of that picture in the video i linked to and even the NASA site you linked to shows the fact that the darker picture is the first one, the original from 1969, while the more lighten edited version came out 1975. So why you arguing? you dont have a chance here.

False misleading information should never be tolerated! Its already proven that the """"fall-off"""" darker version IS the original.

""" Gibraltar self-government Dear Justin, I can't understand why you delete my edits on the Gibraltar article and then post the following comment in my page: """"You currently appear to be engaged in an edit war according to the reverts you have made on Gibraltar."""" I have not intended to start an edit war, just eliminated a reference that seems controversial and was not supported by any reference (1) and repositioned some uncontroverted facts (2): 1) The article began with the expression """"Gibraltar (...) is a self-governing British overseas territory (...)"""". This was not supported by any objective reference in the article and, in fact, it is something not endorsed by the UN (see below), which at least provides some ground for not accepting the self-government of Gibraltar as a self-evident fact. Therefore, I substituted it for some referenced facts. 2) The article referenced the fact that Gibraltar is on the UN's non self-governing territories list but British and Gibraltarian polititians think that it should be removed. Only it was lost somewhere in the middle of this (long) article. I repositioned this information to the introduction of the article where it summarises the territory's political nature. It does not matter if 50 years ago it was the UK who nominated Gibraltar for the list: this status is reviewed every year and has not yet been reverted by UN's Special Committee. What surprises me is: I would have expected that if you disagree with my edits, you would discuss them or, if you think they do not offer a holistic view, you complete them with additional referenced facts. Instead of that, you just deleted the edits and accused me of edit warring. I will appreciate your discussing the changes and contributing with additional insight and referenced facts. Please do not merely undo my edits. Kind regards. If you want to discuss this the appropriate place is the talk page of the article, not here as this is not a matter between you and justin. The reality is that since the 2006 constitution Gibraltar is manifestly self governing, sadly progress on delisting it by the UN C24 is hampered by Spain's foolish attitude and intransigence. It is amusing that that committee is comprised of representatives of states with less democracy than Gibraltar and if you follow the proceedings they have been singularly useless in achieving anything in relation to their remit on ANY territory such that the GoG declined to attend further meetings. In relation to the politics of Gibralar, which is what the article is about, the UN is irrelevent - indeed the committee has not even visited the territory in question despite being invited to do so by the GoG and the UK. They are not so much a paper tiger as a limp piece of used bog roll. Please do not insult my intelligence that your intentions were anything other than to push a POV with that edit. The facts remain that Gibraltar is self-governing. It is only Spain that for its own political agenda denies this and the UN C24 is discussed in the article. Your POV edit sought to give those facts WP:UNDUE prominence. Your behaviour was also to edit war to keep that edit, hence my warning was appropriate.

Following is a small sampling of Irvine22's more recent edits. Note that I have only selected edits for which there was no consensus, that were later reverted. These also all occurred after his block and subsequent sockpuppetry. They also occurred after he was repeatedly told not to edit the article without first seeking consensus, or at the very least providing an adequate source. The edits: This edit was reverted, and a new section started on the talk page. Instead of trying to reach a consensus, he restored the edit with the explanation """"per discussion"""". It was not. This POV edit was reverted. Irvine22 restored it. It was reverted again. So he restored it again. It was reverted again and he was told to bring the matter up on the talk page. So he restored it again. And again. And again. Actually a quick glance at the page's history will show you the behaviour he regularly partakes in. I really wish I could link to more, but I simply don't have the time. Rest assured, there are dozens. Talk page disruption begins here Irvine22 has also been dismissive of advice and instructions to change his editing habits, as can be seen here, and especially on the PIRA talk page, beginning here. Note Irvine22's polite yet dismissive tone throughout all of this. He is almost pathologically incapable of acknowledging any wrongdoing on his part, or criticism of his actions. I am not sure if this is a deliberate attempt to game, or the result of some actual personality disorder for which he cannot be fully faulted. I haven't the time to go digging through his edit history. I really wish I did. I will, however, link to this page on the PIRA talk page and invite further comments from the editors there. Thank you for your time. P.S. I apologize if this request is not in the correct category. It crosses several, and I didn't want to pigeonhole it as a 3rr issue, as the problem extends far beyond simple edit warring.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Not so. The Highland Scots spoke Gaelic. The historic common language of the Lowands however was Northern English - from the 7th century onwards brought by the Anglo-Saxons who arrived in Caledonia at almost exactly the same time as the Scots. It continued to be called English (often spelled Inglis and other variants) until the very end of the 15th century when some Scots, correctly or incorrectly, began calling their northern variant(s) of English 'Scots'. They had previously called Gaelic 'Scots'. Scots-English (in addition to Scots) was certainly commonplace by the Act of Union in 1707 - and indeed was already commonplace by the time of the King James bible in 1611. Historic spelling sometimes gives a quite false impression of difference, but there was no real standard spelling anywhere in Britain, in England or Scotland, until the 18th century. Today some believe that Scots was and is a different language from English, others that Scots is simply the collective name for the historic variants of English found in Scotland.",0,0,0,0,0,0

They say they think they can change people from having homosexual attraction in way that minimise this, or even have heterosexual attraction. The APA has said quite categorically that there is no evidence to support claims like these. I don't see that people's delusions, even if they are experts, need a place in the lead of an article in which they only feature marginally. They feature marginally, because the therapy is seen as fringe by the mainstream psychological and psychiatric communities. The only people who take it seriously usually do so from a religious perspective, and the APA has also stated that religious interests have no expertise on these matters, and should stick to religion. It is a fringe theory, because very few practitioners in this area hold it as having any merit, and there is no evidence to support it.

"As the dog returneth to his own vomit... . Brief history: On my return from holiday, last week, I discovered that another editor, had posted a which criticises my conduct and alleges that I am part of a concert-party aimed at articles substantially edited by him. During May 26h., I tried to add comments to the page and then had a discussion with him, above, which closed the matter between us.The following day, I posted links on the Talk pages of the other alleged conspirators, one of whom is . The entire correspondence with him reads as follows: ==Discussion involving you==You might be interested in the discussion on my 'Talk Page', here, which indirectly involves you. It is disappointing that the author has not notified you himself. (talk) Seen all that. Out of context, of course, in every sense. In addition its dredged up from some time back when we were all wrapped over the knuckles then. It seems he wants people perpetually punished for not agreeing with him or for voting on the same pages. I'd hate to list all the AfD and other pages he and Vintagekits collaborate on. But thats all right. Regards, :Yes; the image of a dog licking its own balls comes to mind. (talk) The metaphor is supposed to represent a self-indulgent act which gives great pleasure to the participant but which others view as embarrassing and repulsive. The next thing I know is that some random Admin has popped up, blocked me, and disappeared again, reappearing on the Administrator's Noticeboard waving my scalp around. The diff link on the Noticeboard refers to the last post only, and a number of commentators on the Noticeboard immediately agree with the view that it is a WP:NPA. I pause here to point out that either the Admin herself, or I (before I was blocked), could have blanked the comment, perhaps with a warning on this Talk page. I would have been perfectly happy to have done so myself, because I like to think of myself as reasonable and because the post was not intended as an attack; had I wished to criticise I would have done so on my own Talk page discussion with him. (As it is, had the sense to blank the discussion in any case.) Anyway, that said, I reply as follows to those who have posted comments here: ' I hope that I have demonstrated that we're at cross-purposes. Frankly, however, you've made no attempt to engage with either myself or or to resolve the dispute between us. You might just as well have blocked one of us at random. ' Thank you for yours. You're the dog's bollocks! ' Point taken, for what it's worth (I had initially understood 's complaint to be with the vulgarity of the metaphor rather than her seeing it as an attack). !vote discussions increasingly resemble a mass outbreak of Tourette's syndrome. ' Thank you for yours. I note you seem to have had rather an unpleasant discussion with yourself on the subject, and I should like to thank you for your interest and understanding. I have also had a look at your User page, which I found very interesting and would like to comment further on your Talk page in due course. To answer your point, I did see how to request an unblock, but as the block was only for 24 hours, and the ground had anyway been cut from under my feet by 's posting on the Administrator's Noticeboard which had garnered approval for the block. I also dislike complaining to Admins about other people's behaviour; it just seems a bit wet to me (and I don't do it myself).

"That’s not really long and irrelevant. I mean, I told you above about General McCully who was always talking about really irrelevant things. Once he told me a story about myself (I’m not sure why I’d never been told it before by my family, but there you go, that’s families for you – not that I wish to make disparaging remarks about my family, they were quite nice, only you’d think that they’d tell me important things like this thing that General McCully told me). Anyway, this story went as follows (of course, it being a long time since I lived in Fifestead, I won’t get it absolutely 100% word perfect, but I’ll get the plot details correct, which is all that matters in the long run, and in the short run too, probably): Once, I went to tea with a girl called Sophie (to fully appreciate this amusing, and I may add, most relevant anecdote, you must realise that there was no romantic interest between myself and Sophie: in fact, we were both only four or five at the time; these ages are, you will no doubt agree, far too young for any real romantic interest to be taking place). Anyway, for reasons General McCully couldn’t quite remember (I was at least ten at the time, and being a fairly old man, General McCully didn’t have a fantastic memory), this girl Sophie (you may remember – she was the one towards whom I had no amorous intentions) put her spoon in my hair. Now, at this point in the story, you may well be saying to yourself, “So what?” But, the problem was, the spoon had a fairly large amount of yoghurt on it. So this was, as you’ll no doubt appreciate, quite a difficult situation, and in the confusion I couldn’t help noticing the slightly random (and, I’ll have to admit, irrelevant) fact that the screws on which Sophie’s mother’s pictures were attatched to the wall required a flathead, rather than a Phillips, screwdriver (when I say flathead, do not use this term in its most obvious, literal definition, but as the DIY term in fairly common use). Anyway, there was me sitting with yoghurt coursing down my face, examining the screws on my hostess’ mother’s pictures, and casting dark aspersions, and eventually I just walked out and went home, all on my own. Now, when I make all these claims about being very friendly with a General, he may not actually be a General: the British Army (the army in which he had served) had several ranks containing the slightly bizarre, random and irrelevant term “General”, including Major-General, and I don’t know if he was simply one of these, since they’re usually addressed simply as “General”, as was the citizen of Fifestead General McCully. Come to think of it, there even used to be a Brigadier-General rank and even a weird-sounding Captain-General rank in the British army, though I believe the rank of Brigadier-General still lives on in the United States Army, existing under some obscure, weird, bizarre, random and irrelevant star rating too, such as “three-star general”, though this almost certainly (speaking with an unfirm knowledge of that field of mathematics known as probability) isn’t the right term for the rank of Brigadier-General. Anyway, being a busy person, I can’t waste any more of my valuble time on this, unfortunately.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"It slows trains down because the existing speed limits already have a significant margin of safety built in so the engineer can exceed them by small amounts and still remain safe. With PTC such fluctuations over the posted limit will trigger an overspeed alarm with the result that crews will check their speed several mph below what is authorized. PTC does not increase capacity except possibly on low density lines that were previously not signaled. ACSES does not actually handle any sort of anti-colision duties. Those are covered by the legacy fixed block cab and wayside signaling system. On non-ACSES routes the PTC unit is attached to the wires leading to the wayside signal. If reliable enough this can provide the same functionality as cab signals, but at a far higher price point. Just because wireless data is involves does not mean PTC is the same as moving block or CTBC. Finally because of the reliance of wireless links, PTC systems are prone to disruption just like your cell phone or WiFi or digital TV signal. It is a whole raft of components, all with their own failure rates that will require contingency operations when they stop working. If those systems were never installed those instances of degraded operations caused by PTC and only PTC would never be encountered.",0,0,0,0,0,0

""" Dear Sitush, I understand your point. If you see this WP Only a few are cited from inscriptions, most of them are well supported by Book citations ( I mean I have given book citations as secondary, I have provided more than 2-3 citations as backup). Please remember that those inscriptions are genuine and they are not manipulated or tricky. Once can easily corelate the inscription to the actual Rajus WP content. For E.g The inscription A.R No. 283 of 1924 (krishna dist)says """"States that a certain Brahmin Chavali Bhaskara consecrated the image of Chagi-Ganapesvara and that king Chagi Manma endowed the temple with land. Describes the Chagi family as of Kshatriya caste (bahujakula) and gives the donor’s genealogy."""" > from this inscription We derive Chagi family as belonging to Kshatriya caste - There is only Chagi royal family in entire telugu society, i.e Chagis of Kshatriya Raju's who ruled Krishna dist, later they ruled Peddapuram kingdom also. There are several inscriptions/books/evidences about Rajus/Rajulu as they have been in ruling since 5th century right from Eastern Chalukyas, after medieval period certainly ther kingdoms started diminishing except one or two. one can see my contribution to this Rajus WP since three years, I have removed content which was puffery and added content which I was sure about and genuine with backing evidence. I can surely say this Rajus WP just reflects 40-50% of their glorious history. Whatever content I written/write I am sure Majoritarian Andhra historians will agree with me. I agree with you on the point that most of Indian caste make puffery out of nothing, For this I would suggest to Wiki Founders to induldge the Genuine Historians of respective region like Andhra Historical Research Society to be involved and review the caste/community specific WP.

""" I can think of several citations for the Personality section, most of them quotes by Jafar himself. I shall list them below. Jafar is portrayed as a megalomaniac (Jafar himself crows """"The power, the absolute POWER!"""") who will not hesitate to destroy anyone he perceives as a threat to his own sinister designs (""""I think it's time to say goodbye to Prince Abubu""""). He wears a metaphorical mask of normalcy throughout the film, establishing himself as a cool-headed schemer and gaining the trust of those around him (""""You are most gracious my liege"""" - """"I assure you your highness, it won't happen again""""), despite his rather untrustworthy physical appearance. Even with this mask, Jafar's villainous tendencies tend to seep through and become apparent to the viewer, particularly in the opening sequence, where Jafar displays no remorse in sending Gazim the Thief to his death in the Cave of Wonders, simply proclaiming that """"Gazim was obviously less than worthy"""" in a rather dry tone of voice. The deleted song """"Humiliate the Boy"""" also establishes Jafar as an emotional sadist, getting a laugh out of seeing """"another fellow's dreams turn into nightmares one by one"""" and treating the Genie in an especially harsh manner (one only has to watch the video, a link to which is provided, in which Jafar viciously tugs the genie's beard several times whilst shouting orders like """"Do as I say""""). It is not until Jafar gains control of the Genie's lamp that he fully shows his true colors, becoming even more arrogant and short-tempered with his subjects after usurping power from the Sultan (""""Don't talk back to me you big blue lout! You are to do what I order you to do! Slave). It is this impulsive behavior that leads to his downfall, as he uses his third wish to become an omnipotent genie, unaware of the life inside the lamp that he now has to endure. Jafar is usually shown to be somewhat comedic and plucky (giving a slightly human side to his usual malevolence, a trait not often seen in Disney villains), even in his times of evil and cunning, proclaiming """"Ewww..."""" when contemplating decapitation. This, however, doesn't keep Jafar from having a sub-par sense of humor himself, spurting several puns in a row while keeping Aladdin and his friends from getting the lamp during the film's climax (""""Your time is up!"""", """"Don't toy with me!"""", """"Things are unraveling fast now, boy!"""", """"Get the point?"""", """"I'm just getting warmed up!"""") This comical humor does not carry over in the film's direct-to-video sequel, which aimed to make Jafar more sinister and ruthless, though it is referenced in Jafar's role in """"Hercules and the Arabian Night"""".

MSF (Microsoft Flight) does in fact contain every bit of a """"real"""" flight sim (except its way more realistic, environmentally), but you don't have to. That's the whole and entire arguement. Many old time players heard that anyone could simply fly with a mouse and they lost their minds. But you can turn that all off, the automatic stuff. It will allow you the complete flight simulator experience of MSFS (Microsoft Flight Simulator and other sims), except not everyone will have to do it like that, and the weather (fog, clouds, light, shadow, etc) will be much more realistic. Take a look at that cockpit view of the Maule, all those buttons, switches, knobs, pedals can be used, all of it. The complete control is there; only some kid or grandma might be using their mouses and have all of that stuff being done for them by the computer. And they, the fanboys errr I mean the serious aircraft simulators, hate that so very much. Go to any flight sim forum and read all the rage, it's insane.

""" anybody feels that is nugget of information should be added to the Limerick article, they can add it in two seconds. Merge notices are for situations when two long and complex articles need to be merged. Here it is a quick decision. Go for it. Dictionary it, or delete it? Merge notices are for where an editor has suggested a merge, no more and no less. Moreover, you appear to have a broken sense of direction. The notice is a {{mergefrom}} not a {{mergeto}}. Both articles discuss the city of Limerick. We don't have duplicate articles about the same thing here. However, the reason that I suggested the merge, rather than outright did it, is that clearly the claim that Limerick is known as """"Stab City"""" for the reasons stated needs to be checked. The article, like so many such articles, doesn't cite any sources. With the notice, other editors will come to the discussion, and perhaps they may attempt to verify the article to be merged and say """"That's a load of old baloney! Limerick isn't known as Stab City at all."""" and instead decide that rather than a merger, an outright deletion of Stab City for being unverifiable is called for. Or, on the other hand, they may come up with some sources to cite. Either way achieves a better result than just doing the merger. The merge notice is not intended to draw attention to stubs needing work. You could have posted a note on this talk page. Limerick is known as 'Stab City' (or used to be a few years ago anyway) but it is derogatory. There are seperate articles for city nicknames - see Big Apple. Googling '""""Stab City"""" -Limerick' turns up 1000 sites, including a US band. So Stab City could be perhaps a disambig. It wasn't a stub needing work. It was, and is, a duplicate article, plain and simple. Both articles are about the city. I've pointed this out several times, now. I've also pointed out that the parallel with Big Apple is a clearly false one. You haven't explained why it is 'clearly' false. The Big Apple is a nickname for New York and contains the history of the usage of that name. """"Stab City"""" is a nickname infrequently used to refer to Limerick in a derogatory way. The """"Stab City"""" article has almost no content, but could be expanded to be a history of the usage of the name. I don't have the time or interest to do this. Another example is Big Easy which redirects to New Orleans, or City of Light which redirects to Paris. If City of Light was an article containing one sentence: """"City of Light usually refers to Paris."""" would you put a merge note on Paris too? If it were as superficially bogus as """"stab city"""" was: Yes, of course. This process is known as """"asking for the opinions of other editors"""". It is a useful tool in some circumstances. Notice that it works. Two editors have already given different opinions here, and a third is forming an opinion. It is possible to ask without adding a merge notice. As you seem to agree that the article is potentially bogus, and that we are now having a discussion about it, I have removed the merge notice. I've restored it. The notice is there not just to get your attention alone, and I wrote """"as superficially bogus as 'stab city' was"""". Uncle G, How would you like to progress with this dispute? Uncle G has not replied for 5 days. I have added a one line of text to the article and have removed the merge notice. The Stab City article is inaccurate in any case - the nickname dates back to well before the late 1990s and first arose after an incident in which an Argentinean tourist was stabbed. I think this was in the mid 1980s. I haven't edited the Stab City article as I'm undecided as to whether it's worth having. Merge it now - stab city is unfortunately associated with Limerick but it being regrettable is not an excuse to suppress it, but it certainly does not need a separate article. I agree, merge it now. I can't see a realistic prospect for Stab City to become a full article. I think there's a case for a Crime in Limerick article, but not for one on this piece",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Hi Enrico! Thank you for your message and kind words; they're very much appreciated! Thank you also for the correction you're suggesting. I will look into the sources I used for the Planxty reunion dates and locations, and then update this section later on. Normally, I would do this straight away but I am quite busy at the moment and will be for the next few days. However, please know that I will definitely aim to fix this if I can, as I am always striving to ensure there is a third-party source for everything I contribute to the encyclopaedia. Of course, if some of these 3rd-party sources are wrong, then it's going to be tricky! I also notice that you are a brand new user, who has made your first edit today, and to my user page! So, a very warm welcome to you and I hope you will enjoy your time here, either as a reader or maybe also as a contributing editor. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if your user and/or talk pages get supdated very soon with a 'Welcome' message from editors who like to take 'newbies' (= newcomers) under their wings. But if you look at my user page, you will see that I collected a lot of links to Wikipedia articles that provide details about editorial guidelines, such as the 'Manual Of Style' (Wiki:MOS). May I also suggest that, if you want some help in getting started as an editor, you can ask me and I will edit a few pointers in your own user- and talk-pages. You don't *have* to do any of these things, but if you're interested and have the time, then I'l be happy to help you in your first steps. So, just let me know, OK? Finally, although I made quite a few changes to the 'Planxty' article (and especially to the 'Andy Irvine (musician)' article), one of the essential principles of our encyclopaedia is that these articles do not 'belong' to any one editor: we all contribute what we can without any article ever becoming 'mine'. In my case, I just happen to have been a Planxty (and Irvine) fan for a long time and had kept a lot of reference material (mainly my collection of folk music magazines) that proved very useful to update the articles. I am still working on the Irvine article and the next tasks will be to create related articles for some of the albums. Then, of course, we need more photos but these are very difficult to include because of the copyright rules in Wikipedia.",0,0,0,0,0,0

I have used the screen name """"Moulton"""" since 1990, when I began developing science education resources on the Internet as a member of an educational technology research group funded by the National Science Foundation. The articles I co-authored with Professor Picard were also funded by a grant from the NSF. My allegiance is to the cause of science and science education, and that is the role I propose to play here. To keep the peace, I will propose below the insertion of an intervening section between the biographical material and the disputatious """"Darwin Dissent Controversy"""" that some editors here wish to retain on this page with appalling disregard for the ground truth. My concern is that some of the existing material is based on unwarranted assumptions regarding people whose names appeared on the original 2001 untitled two-sentence petition. My concern is that the unwarranted assumptions constitute a potentially libelous violation of the WP:BLP """"Do No Harm"""" clause by propagating dubious claims of the DI as if they were established facts. Elsewhere I have managed to highlight the passages where Wikipedia articles have blithely adopted the DI's view of the controversial petition without first examining the evidence for their dubious view with a sufficiently keen and skeptical eye. Please bear with me and extend to me the courtesy of patience and good faith, as I am not conversant with all the Wikipedia conventions regarding resolution of disputatious content appearing on the biographies of living persons.

Thanks A short note of thanks for the explanation (the first cogent one I've seen) and statesman like manner of handling these issues. Your concern for wiki comes through and having allowed a little time to pass and having reread your note a few times I realise my support for the underlying concept of wiki is undiminished. There seems to be no concern about uploaded images and I'll take that advice about links and propose them on the article discussion page (maybe those that are externally approved as educational resources would be appropriate suggestions) and leave it the wiki community to take it from there. Not sure how future reviewers recognise that links have been added legitimately in this way eg the Brookwood Cemetery link which has been through this process and removed again and reinstated again!

""" Anti-Serb sentiment is an umbrella term or generalization, obviously it will be poorly sourced just as List of Massacres in the Kosovo war is a WP creation. We find a subject then we link sources/stories to it but many articles do not represent a real world phenomenon. The fact is that Serbophobia as a concept is not a """"myth"""" but it is confined to the nation's sympathizers and is rejected by the nation's detractors. Obviously Serbophobia is more degrading and more emphatic than """"anti-Serb sentiment"""" in that implies an outright hatred. Naturally no Serb can truly accept no nation recognizing their declared states in Croatia (Krajina) and Eatern Bosnia during the Yugoslav Wars, seeing a West-brokered peace deal in 1994 putting at end to Bosniak-Croat hostilities then all uniting for a joint attack to end the Serb rebel states alongside world powers and claiming that the unlawful grounds for existence of those states was that they were not AVNOJ entities - and then a few years later support the UCK in Kosovo, pushing from the first moment to have FRY forces expelled, succeeding after airstrikes then nine years later recognize Kosovo - no AVNOJ argument there. But it doesn't end there, Kosovo achieved widespread positive feedback from US recognition to """"welcoming of independence"""" from organizations such as the Basque authority in Spain - all entitled to their own opinions, but Serbs who claim Serbophobia are neither stupid nor blind to world events. You don't get the same positive and warm reception let alone recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia nor many other would-be states to exist or to have existed before being retaken by an aggressor (in the eyes of locals). These feats give Serbs to feel they are victims of international protectionism and that alone is enough to prove the sentiment.

""" Ernie Smith writes Æµ§œš¹ I attempted to address the question that you posed regarding other inaccuracies but at the behest of User Hoary I have been blocked by the Wikipedia administrators. That said, you should carefully examine what I did in fact state regading the four ways that Baugh posits as being the Afrocentric proponent's view on Ebonics. I maintain that just because a writer happens to be Black or African American (Weddington, Baugh and Green for example) being Black does not make their postion on Ebonics Afrocentric. What I stated was that; """"the proponents of the term Ebonics view and use the word Ebonics only one way. That way being; from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective."""" I went on to state that """"In fact, a careful analysis of what Baugh posits as number (iii) reveals that this view is not Afrocentric at all. That is, the view that Ebonics “is the equivalent of black English and is considered to be a dialect of English"""" (and thus merely an alternative term for African American Vernacular English|AAVE” is Eurocentric. The other three views, numbers (i), (ii) and (iv), are Afrocentric..."""" Æµ§œš¹, if you re-read the quote above carefully you will see that are clearly in error regarding what I stated concerning Baughs number (ii). So let me make it clear here. It is my view that the first phrse in number (ii)that reads; """"to refer to the languages of the African diaspora as a whole”, is definitely Afrocentric. What I questioned was the second phrase or clause in number (ii) that reads; “or it may refer to what is normally regarded as a variety of English language|English: either”. I contend that this phrase contradicts the first phrase and is therefore and oxymoron. The fact that Eurocentric writers attempt to filch, redfine and use the word Ebonics to """"refer to what is normally regarded as a variety of English language"""" does not make this practice Afrocentric. To User:DESiegel I am indeed very well aware that languages change over time. In fact I co-authored a book on the origin of the """"N' word and in that book I extensivly addressed how the meaning of the Kemetic (Egyptian)word NGR has changed. In this book Shaba Shebaka and I systematically demonstrate that while all English language dictionaries posit the origin of the 'N' word as being derived from the Latin word 'niger' meaning 'black', (See Ullaman, et.al. Third Latin Book (1930:51) the word 'niger' is not originally a Latin word. (see America Heritage Dictionary (1976:1531) That is, while the word 'niger' may have entered into the English langange from Latin, the empirical evidence is that the tri-consonant Mdw Ntr 'NGR' is found in the ancient Kemetic (Egyptian) language thousnds of years before there is any record of a Latin civilization. The empirical evidence is that the root word NGR was introduced to the Ayran or European people when they initially invaded and made contact with the Negroid people (NGRS) of ancient India around 2000-1000 BC. (See Wallbank and Taylor(1942:72,73)and Durant (1954:356). In Sir E.A. Wallis Budge's Egypitian Hieroglyphic Dictionary the words NGRS and NGGR can be found in hieroglyphs. Budge provides the specific site where these hieroglyphs are located in Egypt today. As defined by Budge the first word NGRS is the name of an ancient Kemetic or Egyptian God (Budge 1978:341). The second word NGGR is the name of an ancient Kemitic or Egyptian Goddess (Budge 1978:398). For the Wikipedia reader that may be concerned as to the relavence of this discussion of the 'N' word to Ebonics I strongly urge the reader to examine the etymology and definition of the word """"ebony"""" in any unabridged English language dictionary. The point being made is that there is a subtle linguistic diglossia being imposed that must to be challenged. Einar Haugen states the point I am making thusly: """"if we call the building-up of a language an Aufbau and the aphasic dismantling an Abbau, the bilinguals restructuring can be call an Umbau. This is the goal of all the studies if bilingual interference: in what way has a language been rebuilt or umgebaut because of the coexistence with another language in the minds ofbilingual speakers?"""" Of course to those who view Ebonics as being a dialect of English the idea of 'biligualism' when it comes to the languge of descendants of enslaved Niger-Congo Africans in diappora is unfathomable.

What if the beam started lower, if the beam, was closer the the S, would more mass go to the S, would there be a point, where it would not split anymore? How many people repeated this experiment? Answer: In 1925 most people did not even believe there were electrons. There is no spin, no electrons. It is a radiation pressure. Seccond, there is no such thing as having an N one place and an S in anther place. they are apart of the same magnet.

""" Nothing personal Radh, I appreciate the input. My rant is directed at Toa mostly. I realize, Tao, you are being a smart ass as if my suggestion is not practical. You like to use so called wikipedia rules to hide your empty, meaningless claims. How about this for a rule: 1) before you comment on other people, read what they say; 2) before you comment on the page, read the page. You seem to refuse to do either and continue to make smart ass comments for what seems to be the sole purpose of antagonizing well intentioned posters. You have refused to do the one thing necessary to anyone who genuinely intends to help imporove this page: actually read the page and actually read others' comments. While I believe Radh is well intentioned, he or she partly suggests things that already exist on the page (please see the """"writers"""" section, what used to be the lead section which Doom, who has been working ont his page for a very long time, moved lower both Doom and I have been working on this page a very long time; both Doom and I have actually read the page because both Doom and I have actually written much of this page; the comments Doom and I make on the discussion page are well intentioned, practical, and based on knowledge of the page, none of which applies to your comments, Tao). Not only have your comments suggested a stubborn refusal to actually read the page or read the comments of others; they also demonstrate a pervasive hypocricy and your comments thoroughly contradict one another. I suggested mention of the abstract expressionists as a part of broader concept of the beat generation and you go ape shit. Radh suggests it and it's an excellent and practical solution. It makes no sense to me. I can't help thinking you have tourettes or something, finger tourettes, that causes you to be incapable of typing anything but bullshit. Now a direct response to Radh. What I am suggesting is an accurate, middle-of-the-road definition. They are not simply ideas. Please read my comments above. According to sources I found through a search method intended to eliminate prejudice, """"beat generation"""" means most commonly a subculture, not a close circle. I'm not suggesting we change the page to focus less on the close circle. I'm suggesting we change it to more accurately represent the truth so that certain dumbasses have context with which to argue whether or not someone belongs in the group. If someone says there is no such thing as a beat artists, we can point at reliable sources and point to places on the page that clear this up in a neutral, accurate way. So, while I appreciate your good intentions, Radh, this is not an """"excellent and practical solution"""" because it's not an actual change which would be clear to certain other posters if they actually read the article. Here, I'll make it easy for you Tao: Beat Generation. It's just right there. One click away. Take ten minutes, take an hour, whatever.

"It's a good question. I've kind of gone back and forth on it over the years, but I've been finding lately that when I've been updating licensees as a result of an acquisition, I've been linking the licensees to the owner's page more often (or at least when I remember to do so). In fact, while I was FCC-less today, I was starting to look at categorization of the larger owners, which is kind of related. The only reason I did the iHeartMedia linking today was because I checked my Watchlist last night for the first time in a while, and saw that there'd been a bunch of changes made in error to the licensees a week or so ago. I figured that while I was cleaning them up anyway, adding the link made sense, and then it was suggested to me that the redirects made more sense than the piping. Yes, I'd say each of the state pages should absolutely be uniform, just the same as how the alphabetical lists are uniform and the frequency pages are at least uniform-ish. I'd lean toward linking all of the columns other than the frequency, although I wouldn't suggest redlinking licensees where the owner doesn't have a page. That said, that's just my opinion - it's a question that should probably be put to the project, to see what those who are still active in the project think. It'd be a big chunk of work to implement if links end up having to be added, although it's the kind of gnoming that's right up my alley, as you know. >)",0,0,0,0,0,0

The CC-by-sa license is a true free documentation license that is similar to Wikipedia's license, the GFDL, but it allows other projects, such as WikiTravel, to use our articles. Since you are among the top 2000 Wikipedians by edits, I was wondering if you would be willing to multi-license all of your contributions or at minimum those on the geographic articles. Over 90% of people asked have agreed. For More Information: Multi-Licensing FAQ - Lots of questions answered Multi-Licensing Guide To allow us to track those users who muli-license their contributions, many users copy and paste the """"{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}"""" template into their user page, but there are other options at Template messages/User namespace. The following examples could also copied and pasted into your user page: Option 1 I agree to [[Wikipedia:Multi-licensing|multi-license]] all my contributions, with the exception of my user pages, as described below: {{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}} OR Option 2 I agree to [[Wikipedia:Multi-licensing|multi-license]] all my contributions to any [[U.S. state]], county, or city article as described below: {{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}} Or if you wanted to place your work into the public domain, you could replace """"{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}"""" with """"{{MultiLicensePD}}"""". If you only prefer using the GFDL, I would like to know that too. Please let me know what you think at my talk page. It's important to know either way so no one keeps asking. (comment| talk) Thomas John Barnado I just wanted to draw your attention to a matter of style. We don't usually include a person's titles in the article name - so we have Winston Churchill and not Sir Winston Churchill. Therefore we already had an article at Thomas John Barnardo which covers his life and work in some detail. What I've done is made your article Dr Thomas Barnado a redirect, so that anyone who goes to it will automatically be sent to the existing one. (also note the spelling error).

"Hello Ensiform. I'm not impressed by the dozens of books at Amazon, for the simple reason that they're all published by American Research Press or other vanity presses. I have looked for peer-reviewed work by others about Smarandache functions and what-not, and there appear to be about three papers or a maybe a few more. But I think that's not immediately relevant, as I'll try to state below. Smarandache appears to use publicly available resources to promote himself very diligently. Usenet, FOLDOC, Mathworld at wolfram.com, and even Sloane's On-Line Encyclopedia of Sequences all have lots of Smarandache-related entries. Sloane's is an interesting case, since each entry lists an author, and for the Smarandache entries the authors are charlestle@yahoo.com and other possible pseudonyms. Also,the link shown on the FS talk page (http://www.uoregon.edu/~ncp/Spam/SpamFiles3/DigitalLibSpam.txt) appears to show him sending unsolicited email under an assumed name. This suggests to me that it is possible that all edits on the FS page were made by him under assumed names.

But who doesn't enjoy a nice summer's eve? BUT, you need to STOP LYING about me. I never said the Greaseman was dead, only that his death had been reported by sources considered reliable by Wikipedia standards. A little attention to detail on your part would be much appreciated, Eve. Otherwise, perhaps it is I who shall report you. Tell you what: you admit and retract your lie and I will consider the matter closed. Fair? Let's look at your odd writing style: """"If you continue, to add continued, now, lies to Wikipedia,"""" Just what are you going for there? I've never put a lie on Wikipedia, contrary to your assertion. Anyone who lies about me can go screw. Your threat to report me to my ISP (FOR WHAT, EVE?) is beyond pathetic. Two pops for yes!! Report away. Now, the admin who blocked me said that more than one reliable source was needed on sensitive matters. He did not research sufficiently to reach a correct conclusion. Let's all remember, shall we, that I never said that Greaseman was dead, simply that he was REPORTED DEAD. There's a big difference, and the fact that it was reported is not in dispute. I NEVER SAID GREASEMAN WAS DEAD. Yet Neutralhomer continues to assert that I did. THAT IS A LIE. I consider someone lying about me a personal attack, under Wikipedia guidelines. Is this a """"separate but equal"""" or """"separate and unequal"""" system? The admin who blocked me wants more than one source that someone said something on the radio. Let's look at Wikipedia's entry on Cesar Romero's personal life, shall we? There is NO source cited for his death, nor his homosexuality, yet those are all sensitive topics, are they not? Why doesn't Neutralhomer report the author of this page for vandalism? The fact that Neutralhomer claims that dealing with me gave him a migraine on the talk page of the admin who blocked me demonstrates that this is a personally based effort on his part. To recap: I never lied. I never vandalized. That should be enough. Now let's look at Wikipedia's reckless report of Cesar Romero's death and homosexuality, shall we? Sensitive matters, no? Personal life Romero believed in liberation theology. Romero was very Christian yet still believed in a utopian society whose belief is that Christ's kingdom would be very similar to Marx's envisionment of communism, and held to this belief until his death.[1][2] Romero always claimed his grandfather on his mother's side was Cuban poet and patriot José Martí, although his mother's parents were legally Carmen and Manuel Mantilla with José Martí as his godfather. There was some speculation that Maria was fathered by Martí who was a boarder in the Mantilla household, but he never claimed Maria as his daughter in his lifetime. Romero was never married, despite proposing to at least one woman. Romero made regular appearances on the Hollywood social circuit, usually in the company of an attractive actress, and he was almost always described in interviews and articles as a """"confirmed bachelor."""" Romero discussed his homosexuality in a series of interviews with author Boze Hadleigh, with the understanding that they would not be published during his lifetime. Romero wore a man's tennis bracelet inscribed with his favorite nickname: """"Butch."""" The term was reportedly bestowed on Romero by his one-time dancing partner Joan Crawford, who teased Romero by telling him: """"You're so butch!"""" While Romero's homosexuality was an """"open secret"""" in Hollywood, the movie-going public was unaware of his sexual proclivities and there was never any embarrassing scandal surrounding his male liaisons, which shows the care and finesse with which he conducted his private life for more than 60 years. Romero was a mainstay of the Hollywood social circuit until his death in 1994. He was interred at Inglewood",0,0,1,0,0,0

"Source Deletion Hi, just wanted to let you know I restored a table to the Nestle-Aland page. Not sure why you didn't notify me that you were removing it. In any case, I found this source through a Roman Catholic, and it has an imprimatur from that church. I've found other scholarly reviews for it as well, including a peer review from the Society of Biblical Literature. Although I'm sure yours was a good faith edit and a simple mistake, I'm a bit concerned that you didn't ask me about it. I'm also concerned after glancing at your user contribs that you do a LOT of source deletion without discussing this with the other good faith editors that have taken time and research to provide. Although we do need to have sources cleaned up here, we'd actually get along faster if you slow down a bit and discuss the sources with the editors who have provided them. It's a simple courtesy, and would save us all time redoing earlier work. It's tough writing an encyclopedia, but continuously REwriting it is even harder. Just so you'll know, I do not add sources that I do not personally own. I have a rather extensive library, and often purchase books for the purpose of responsibly editing on this site. It's a rather expensive exercise and requires more time than simply deleting sources I'm not familiar with. There have been times that I did not like a source that was listed, and bought several other sources in order to rebuild or supplement information that was insufficiently verified. Again, this is a slower and more expensive process than simple deletion. I'd appreciate it if you do the same. If you don't mind, could you let me know if you have deleted other sources I've provided on this site? After some months away I was looking forward to adding sourced material in the field of stock technical analysis, but I'm now dreading having to go back and research any other places you may have deleted my earlier work in religious or literary subjects. I'd appreciate any help you can give me here so I can move on to other subjects with minimal time restoring any sources that have been removed. Thanks for your help.

""" Fanboy is a term used to describe an individual (usually male; the feminine version fangirl may be used for females) who is utterly devoted to a single fannish subject, or to a single point of view within that subject, often to the point where it is considered an obsession. Fanboys remain loyal to their particular obsession, disregarding any factors (often including logic) that differ from their point of view. Background Stereotypical fanboys are attributed with a sycophantic devotion to the creators and principles behind a work with which they are currently enthralled. Fanboys are noted for a very emotional attachment to their chosen subject, often taking negative remarks about it as a personal attack. They will readily engage in debates, but will fall back on emotional responses when challenged on facts. For example, a fanboy may go out of his way to point out negative and often untrue statements about their obsession's rivals. Fanboys are often hostile towards critical review of their chosen subject. The stereotypical image of the fanboy is as an unkempt, socially awkward young man who may be perceived as a loud mouthed pseudo-intellectual. Fanboys are also typically aggressive and hateful towards the opposing brand or competition of their obsession regardless of its merits or achievements. As electronic entertainment gained popularity, the term became increasingly applied to video game and television addicts. As a result, a subculture emerged which readily labeled itself as """"fanboys."""" Within this group, more effort is taken to fit in with a perceived standard, resulting in a more outgoing attitude, even among those with insecurities. This outgoing stance is often felt to be abrasive by those not involved in the culture as deeply. The term originated in comic book circles, to describe someone who immersed himself in the fictional worlds of comics and the culture of comics fandom. The term is often used in a derogatory manner by other less obsessed fans. The term is most commonly associated with adolescent and teen males but can be applicable to any age or sex. The term fangirl, while similar, often carries slightly different connotations. The term fangirl is often applied to any enthusiastic female fan, regardless of obsessive qualities or not, and is often used with overtones of """"teenybopper"""". History of fanboys and the term The term """"fanboy"""" is most commonly associated with adolescent and teen males but can be applicable to any age or sex. It is often used in a derogatory manner by other, less obsessed fans. The term originated in comic book circles to describe someone immersed in the fictional worlds of comics and the culture of comics fandom. Common subjects of reverence by fanboys are specific: TV shows; movies; music; anime; comic books; cars; video game consoles, video games and MMORPGs; and computer operating systems, hardware and software. Popular depictions of Fanboy stereotypes include the Comic Book Guy on The Simpsons and columnist Larry Groznic from the satirical newspaper The Onion. In the songs of the fannish parody musician Luke Ski, many characters proudly consider themselves fanboys. The earliest published uses of the word """"fanboy"""" have been dated to 1982. One reference is to the cover of the """"Official Underground and Newave Comix Price Guide"""". On this cover page are sketched overweight, overzealous comic book collectors wearing T-shirts that state """"Fanboys of America,"""" who are describing the extreme measures they would go to, including moving to San Francisco, to preserve their comics. Also published in 1982, a comic strip appeared in Jim Engel and Chuck Fiala's """"Fandom Confidential"""" comic. In the strip, Jim and Chuck met comic artist/writer John Byrne and collapsed into """"mindless paroxysms of adoration."""" The John Byrne character responded that they were """"a couple of fanboys in bondage"""" (a play on words referring to a Monty Python sketch in which an Elizabethan era character reads what she claims to be a new Shakespeare work called """"Gay Boys in Bondage"""". http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=7&T1;=Miscellaneous+Questions#154 Another early use is in a smart-alec editorial reply by """"Ambush Bug"""" to a letter in his comic in 1985.

""" The question of head winds. Both the last forecast sent to Earhart and Noonan and their reported conditions agree. It is most likely that they were encountering headwinds as high as 23 knots. It is also certain from her reports that they had climbed considerably above the optimum altitudes early in the flight and thus had to have had considerable additional fuel consumption. I would refer you to Kelly Johnson's instructions prepared for Earhart on the flight profile necessary to achieve optimum range. Given the variables which we cannot know, I would imagine that she had 1-2 hours reserve by the time she reached the vicinity of Howland - but that might be optimistic. I cannot know how much fuel she had. One radio log indicates she stated 1/2 hour (but did that include the remainder of 100 octane?). One thing for certain is that she did state she was """"low on fuel"""" and that cannot be reasonably interpreted as meaning she was """"fat."""" This is OPINION, but given the anxiety she seemed to have in her voice and her use of the term 'low on fuel,"""" coupled with the forecast and reported (by her) winds, it is probable that they were far less than the optimum 4-5 hours given still air and best altitude operations would have made possible. Mr. Gillespie can dismiss her report of ground speed and winds aloft as well as the far higher than optimum altitude she reported less than half way into the flight with the term """"speculation"""" (in a foot note). No one did at the time, nor can I. (OPINION- but) Though this is my Opinion, I CAN document several aspects of it including the airplane designers instructions and how his instructions for an optimum profile differed from her report. Her reports and how they coincided with the last forecast the USN sent her from Hawaii. And thus how if Kelly Johnson was right, True had not incompetently read the information about winds aloft from reporting stations near her path, and she was not lying; then she MUST have had significantly higher fuel consumption than the optimum profile would have produced. How much, that is a question I cannot specifically answer. But for all three to be totally wrong, for there have been still air, for True to have been incompetent in his interpretation of winds aloft reports, and Earhart to have been lying about the """"winds"""" she reported and her """"speed"""" takes a bit of """"speculation"""" I cannot indulge in. Mistakes were made, but I can't imagine everyone made exactly the right combination of mistakes and deceptions to allow the Electra to have achieved it's optimum performance on the flight. Given the time which they apparently (from reports and signal strength) spent searching for Howland Island, it is unlikely that they had a big reserve when the last signal was heard (OPINION).

""" Unauthorised change On 26 January 2014 (i.e. just in the last few weeks), User:Mzilikazi1939 changed this article from the standard form of writing dates in the English language to CE/BCE. As he well knows, this violates WP:MOS, specifically WP:ERA, which requires that any change to an article's date style first be discussed on the talk page and justified with article-specific reasons before consensus is established and the article is then ready to be changed. As is clearly evident to everyone, none of these steps have taken place in this case. Instead, in the two and fro of the last few weeks as Aesop has gone back and forth between the Queen's English and CE/BCE, Mzilikazi and his friends have claimed that the comments much further up this talk page and dated 20 months ago constitute the necessary discussion and consensus for the change of 26/01/14. Apart from the obvious fact that the article remained in the standard English state for 20 months continuously (May 2012 to January 2014), those comments were never enough to justify the change to CE/BCE even back then. This is of course because, as mentioned earlier, WP:ERA requires that article-specific reasons be given and consensus established. Neither occured then. What we see from 2012 can at best be called a disgrace; it was merely Dougweller and his friends making the laughably fallacious and tendentious claim that because there were more of them, they should automatically get their way without having to justify their case or convince anyone of it. The """"discussion"""" went quiet in its unresolved state and the change from the Queen's English (which the article has used since its creation and the overwhelming majority of the time since then) to CE/BCE therefore didn't proceed, at least until 20 months later when Mzilikazi decided to try again, this time without any attempt to follow the proper procedure. If Mzilikazi and his friends want to legitimately change Aesop from the established English language abbreviations to CE/BCE then by all means discuss it here and follow the proper process.

Low interest rates actually reduce liquidity as interest payments are not being made on loans, and thus, money isn't available for financial intermediaries to recycle back into making new loans. The money supply in Japan has been steadily declining for at least the past few years, yet world stock markets have been reaching new highs, and assets of all kinds have been bid to sky-high valuations. Thus, it can be argued that the asset bubble is being driven by money supply expansion in Europe and the United States, and not by the shrinking money supply in Japan.

For example, in wrestling, for years and years, the name """"Last Call"""" was synonymous with a fallaway slam, but that didn't stop TNA from giving that SAME name to a superkick. Sometimes two different moves have the same name. The guys name is Human Tornado and apparently they thought that the move name Cancun Tornado fit his characters name, even though the move wasn't a corkscrew moonsault. PWG has named the move (multiple times) and therefore it should be in the article. """,1,0,0,0,0,0

It seems unreasonable to imply that because there is only one film of a particular genre on a """"best film"""" list, the mention equals a citation for being the best of the genre. That would be original research because the film may have been selected for reasons that have nothing to do with being the best of the genre. ☑ uelWantman Request to delete this page. While I don't disagree with the fact that you can at least narrow down several films which many consider great, this page is misleading. What purpose does it serve? The movies it lists are extremely inconsistent, and this page changes all the time. People will like what they like, and I think it is unfair that wikipedia, a generally factual resource, includes such a subjective topic as this and other polls. I also think that we should delete links to reviews for films and music. What other refutable encyclopedia does this? You cannot systematically grade personal taste. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 66.159.181.59 The point of the page is to list those films that have been previously recognized by a variety of critics and organization. The opinions of these films are not of Wikipedia users, but of a variety of organizations. Regardless of the notoriety of the sources, they don't constitute an article. The citations are to sources of opinion which should, in my opinion, be added to the articles of their respective films. 'Talktome I believe that the page should be deleted, Its very opinionated (yes i know its all sourced from other people) but still who has the deciding line on what the greatest film, there are many variants. This sort of page is suited to someones' blog, not a Wikipedia article. Its a fine line to what should be on Wikipedia but this i think should be deleted. Although this page somewhat irks me, I believe it would most likely make it through a deletion proposal with a Keep decision. The article is technically 100% factual in that it is stating, """"so and so thinks this movie is the greatest."""" Personally, I think that this sort of information on critic and audience opinions should be reserved for the individual entries for the films, and that an attempt to build a list such as this is inherently flawed. Specifically, my problem is that the personal opinions of Wikipedians are bound to show up in this article in that, in many cases, I believe that with enough searching you could find somebody's'' list that has your favorite movie on top.

"I think that it is unlikely that good faith is as much of an issue for most of us as is being unconsciously blind to our own biases. It is clear that Rhwentworth is highly invested in NVC, and while he may have a business COI, I think it is more likely he would simply like to protect NVC from what he sees, given his expertise, as unfair criticism. Sunray is more curious. S/he has, in my opinion, been extremely defensive, tendentious and aggressive, having accused several of us of wikilawyering and harboring a hidden agenda against NVC, as well as claiming we had reached consensus when in fact the defenders (mostly me) had simply given up, having felt bulldozed. S/he has also consistently removed material from the criticisms section, because s/he incorrectly assessed the sources, could not find a convenient link to the source, or because the source was deemed inappropriate for criticismyet left the source in place for material elsewhere in the article. I have no idea why Sunray is so aggressive about critiques of NVC, but I doubt it is a COI or bad faith. The strong objections to the critiques by a number of pro-NVC advocates, such as Sunray and Rhwentworth, essentially consist of the idea that there are no valid criticisms of NVC. In the previous arguments over these sources, the substance of the objection came down to either rejecting the source as unreliable (for criticism but not for promotion) or claiming that the source misunderstands NVC and thus is simply wrong. So at this point, the only critique of NVC we have noted in the article is that it lacks critique. Given the strong and diverse critiques of NVC that have been published, this is sad to me. I pointed out that disparaging of the sources of criticism of NVC as being unreliable, minority, inaccurate etc. should also apply to the sources supporting NVC. On this talk page, I went through every reference in the article and showed that they were nearly all from promotional or minority literature. It is hard to find traditionally reliable (e.g. academic, peer-reviewed, mainstream, etc.) sources for any aspect of NVC. This has marginally improved. I suggested previously that we have a responses section rather than a critique or criticisms section, which I hoped would allow some of the responses from non-academic or non-traditional sources to be aired in the article. We have been stuck arguing about the academic sources, however, so I am thinking that the less reliable sources would not be accepted. I believe that beyond the argument we are having about sources for explicit criticism of NVC, there are other big issues. The article was originally criticized by editors as sounding promotional, and we made some headway in fixing this. Lately, however, the article has again been rewritten, in my opinion, to promote NVC. This consists of burying information that might cast NVC in a less than glorious light and by making the article essentially a description of how the advocates of NVC see it as working, rather than putting it into a context for naive readers. For example, Sunray argued very strongly that NVC is not a conflict resolution technique, but is a trademark of an organization and therefore should not be criticized under the BLP policy. I then added the information that NVC is trademarked to the intro, but this was removed to the very end of the article. (Perhaps there should be an 'sm' next to each mention of NVC, since it is a trademarked item.) The one study of NVC efficacy described in detail in the article as research was published in a non-peer-reviewed newsletter. This information was removed to the reference section rather than staying in the article itself, where I put it. The fact that there is nearly no discussion, research or confirmation of NVC in the literature was removed from the introduction to become the sole critique of NVC, at the end of the article. And, as one of the sources on NVC notes, one critique of NVC is that it is based on beliefs rather than research. This is no longer mentioned in the article explicitly. As far as moving forward, I think the Gorsevski and the Flack sources are high quality and the reasons adduced for exclusion do not seem sufficient. I do not think we have to go into any detail on the contents of their critiques, but we should mention they exist and provide a citation. I also think that one major critique of NVC is that many organization have attempted to adopt it and found it problematic. This is the opinion of one of our high quality academic (and pro-NVC) sources. I think a sentence to this effect should be included, with the reference. I also think it would be legitimate to include here the opencouchsurfing.com and noesis.org mention, and Sarles self-published critique (which is discussed in the academic source). The pro-NVC academic sources are not afraid to address the critiques, so I am not sure why t",0,0,0,0,0,0

""" Point of view terms used in the Scott article In the modern reaction it is said: """"Scott's reputation survived the period after World War II, beyond the 50th anniversary of his death."""" This is rather obvious Point-of-view-terminology. Saying something has survived only until a certain point in time basically means it's dead. Captain Scott's reputation is far from dead, so this is not a true representation of reality. A correct encyclopedic term would be: """"Scott's high reputation remained uncontested until the period after World War II, beyond the 50th anniversary of his death."""" Another problem is that it is spoken of a timeframe beyond World War II, but the first book that is mentioned offering criticism in the next sentence is from 1966. Here we have a difference of more than 20 years that are claimed to belong to the time that Scott's high reputation had been contested, while in reality they belong to the uncontested period. Consequently, this is another passage that needs further rectifying clarfification. """,0,0,0,0,0,0

""" Race and Intelligence: Asian-Americans I've noticed you've contributed much to the race/intelligence articles and thought these articles might interest you: http://paa2009.princeton.edu/papers/90354 """"Using data from recent Current Population Surveys (CPS), this study compares third-and-higher generation with earlier generation Asian Americans and non-Hispanic whites in terms of socioeconomic characteristics and demographics. The findings suggest a “third-generation decline or flattening” for Asian American and white men as well as Asian American and white women. For each of these groups, the mean of years of schooling among the 2.5 and third generations is lower than among the first and second generations. This pattern is most pronounced among Asian Americans. As for wage determination, the generational differentials can be explained by educational attainment and other basic demographic variables. Overall, these results suggest that assimilation beyond the first generation immigrants no longer improves socioeconomic attainments as expected by traditional assimilation theory. Furthermore, in the case of Asian Americans, cultural assimilation across the generations may actually lower educational attainment and thereby reduce wages contrary to traditional assimilation theory."""" """"It is widely noted that Asian immigrant parents have higher educational and socioeconomic expectations and motivations for their children than do non-Hispanic white parents (e.g., Goyette and Xie 1999; Kao 1995, 2004). Asian families also tend to invest more aggressively in financial, human, and within-family social capital than families from other racial groups (e.g., Sun 1998). Yet, protective effects of ethnic cultures and resources decline according to more acculturation into the mainstream U.S. society (e.g., Kao and Tienda 1995). As third-or-higher generation Asians become more “Americanized,” they tend to embrace the prevailing U.S. norm that as long as good efforts have been made based on one’s ability, the outcome would be acceptable even though one has not achieved the best performance or reached a higher level of education (Chen and Stevenson 1989; Stevenson 1988)."""" Likewise... http://www.ibtimes.com/asian-americans-increasingly-defying-stem-stereotype-246578 """"Shinagawa pointed out another interesting phenomenon; later generation (second, third, fourth, etc.) Asian Americans on average have markedly lower education and income compared to immigrant Asians. In 2007, 33 percent of PhDs conferred in the U.S. were to Asians. However, of that 33 percent, only 2 percent were Asians Americans born or raised in the U.S."""" These trends are reflected in their TIMSS/PIRLS scores, which are often used by people like Charles Murray and Richard Lynn as proxies for IQ. http://i39.tinypic.com/zob4p0.png Note that native born Asian-Americans perform worse than native born Whites in every subject. My goal here is not to put down Asian-Americans, but I've noticed that lots of modern racialists like to use Asians as a battering ram against other minorities. Yet, as the above evidence indicates, even """"model minorities"""" who start from a much more advantageous position than the others can still succumb to negative cultural influences which significantly hurt their academic performance. This suggests that culture does, indeed, matter greatly, even on exams like the TIMSS which supposedly test for 'g'.

As an Automotive Engineer, with a keen interest in vehicle dynamics, I can assure you that traction control and EDL are operate in two very different methods. All traction control systems monitor differential axle wheel speeds comparing the driven axle to the non-driven axle - any differences outside the scope of the allowed tollerances will ONLY result in either (a) BOTH driven wheels on the same axle being braked, or (b) the engine ECU reducing engine output, or (c) a combination of (a) and (b).

"Support: An Advanced Google search in English over the last year for Beersheba excluding Be'er Sheva and Wikipedia gives 59,200 hits (page through to the last result and it turns out to be 557 unduplicated hits). Restrict that to sites in Israel in English, and you get 2,520 hits (465 unduplicated hits). A similar search for Be'er Sheva excluding beersheba and Wikipedia gives 26,100 hits (which turns out to be 533 unduplicated hits) or, when restricted to sites in Israel 9,850 hits (which turns out to be 511 unduplicated hits). This suggests that useage in Israeli English certainly favours Be'er Sheva, but not by as convincing a margin as might be expected (52 per cent to 48 per cent). In the world as a whole, Beersheba still has the edge (but only by 51 per cent to 49 per cent). However, while all the results for Be'er Sheva are for the town, there are a significant number of Beersheba hits that relate to other things, including an Australian army reorganisation plan, an aid project in Senegal, a farm in England, a religious campsite in the United States, a self-catering resort in New Zealand, an arts and crafts fair in the United States, a town in the United States, a woman in India, a printing company in the Philippines, an architectural restoration competition in the United States, a man in the United Arab Emirates, a community development programme in Uganda, a school in India, another school in India, a religious medical ministry in the United States, a man in the Philippines and a gardening company in New Zealand (and that's just the first 20 pages).

This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article. If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

""" Adding unreferenced entries of former employees to lists containing BLP material Hello, Please do not add unreferenced names as entries to the list of former employees in articles. Including this type of material in articles does not abide by current consensus and its inclusion is strongly discouraged in our policies and guidelines. The rationales are as follows: WP:NOT tells us, Wikipedia is """"not an indiscriminate collection of information."""" As that section describes, just because something is true, doesn't necessarily mean the info belongs in Wikipedia. As per WP:V, we cannot include information in Wikipedia that is not verifiable and sourced. WP:Source list tells us that lists included within articles (including people's names) are subject to the same need for references as any other information in the article. Per WP:BLP, we have to be especially careful about including un-sourced info about living persons. If you look at articles about companies in general, you will not find mention of previous employees, except in those cases where the employee was particularly notable. Even then, the information is not presented just as a list of names, but is incorporated into the text itself (for example, when a company's article talks about the policies a previous CEO had, or when they mention the discovery/invention of a former engineer/researcher). If a preexisting article is already in the encyclopedia for the person you want to add to a list, it's generally regarded as sufficient to support their inclusion in list material in another article. cheers """,0,0,0,0,0,0

(NCDane) I read the naming convention before my previous message to you, and I considered Naming convention citations I originally provded to to constitute superseding, prima facie authority. I think they are worth repeating, and I will repeat them:German proper names should be treated with care, and attention to English practice The title of an article should generally use the version of the name of the subject which is most common in the English language''''(TR) That means an editor must support their position by providing sources that show a common English usage. (NCD) That is ridiculous because the article's previous authors did not provide citation, and the burden should be on them because they were the ones using a letter which does not exist in the English alphabet. Furthermore, you know as well as I do that ~B is not common English usage: I am sure you, like me, have NEVER in your life seen it used in ANY English-language publication EXCEPT for Wikipedia, and perhaps the Internet Wiki copycats.

"Most of us are sympathetic to your personal story, and we understand the importance to you of your relationship with Endal. However, as you have noticed, we have guidelines for what can be included on Wiki. I have been working to make the Endal article conform as closely to those requirements as possible. Dogs that have long pedigrees are not (at the moment, but things may change!) considered to be notable on Wiki. Wiki, however, is quite fluid, and there may be a time when pedigree histories are considered important enough for an entry. The reasoning behind the argument for inclusion of the Endal article on Wiki is not your relationship with the dog, nor its pedigree (it wouldn't matter if Endal was a mongrol), but that there is a considerable amount of media coverage. That the media coverage has been prompted by yourself has caused some alarm, and some questioning of the article - especially as you started the article on Wiki yourself. It just looks like a vanity thing - and we do get a lot of that on Wiki - some people don't quite get that this is an encyclopedia rather than a free home page for whatever they fancy putting on it! However, regardless of who started the article, I feel that the amount of coverage that has been generated by yourself for your dog gives it a certain amount of notability. As you are so close to the subject, there is the question of original research and other Wiki principles that may be broken. I would strongly suggest that you refrain from editing the article until you are more familiar with Wiki procedure - you may just push it into a decision for deletion either now or some point in the future (yes, Endal can be submitted for future considerations for deletion - passing the current discussion does not make it secure!). As you have some interest in dogs, would you be interested in looking at the current dog articles we have on Wiki (:Category:Dogs) and seeing if you can improve those? Warm regards",0,0,0,0,0,0

""" 2009 (UTC) Templating The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time Thanks for soliciting my opinion. There seems to be little support for adding awards and such to infoboxes: Infobox Musical artist And templates for awards of the """"magazine's top ten list"""" type tend to be deleted: Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame inductees I don't have a strong opinion in the matter, but it seems the general preference is to not have awards templated at all, but rather mentioned in the article body text where appropriate, and omitted when such mention gives undue weight to the award. If a template like this is to gain acceptance, it needs to be less intrusive. Putting the 500 Greatest list in the article infobox is the most intrusive possible placement, suggesting that Rolling Stone's perspective on a record is as essential an element as the release date—even I consider that undue weight. If you still want to try this, my suggestion would be a collapsible box placed much lower in the article, the way is placed at the bottom of Miles Davis. However, it might be a good idea to seek feedback on Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Songs before putting much work into this. / ☺ ☭ 17:00, 1 May""",0,0,0,0,0,0

The distinction between those who have died in military style combat or executed under the direction of a lawful court of President Saddam Hussein, although buried disrespectfully, and those who have been victims of genocide, ethnic cleansing or otherwise murdered innocently and buried efficiently is a bright line; mass burial should not be assumed to be evidence of criminal activity.

""" The casual reader should receive the message that the expulsions were agreed to at the Yalta and Potsdam conferences. They should also be aware that Stalin outmaneuvered the gullible Western Allies at both those conferences. Stalin didn't care about the Poles (he killed 22,000 Poles, mostly Polish military officers, at Katyn in 1940); Stalin was more concerned about gaining back lands lost in the early 1920s, namely lands within the 1937 Polish border east of the Curzon Line. That land area had a population which included 40% ethnic Poles. Stalin needed somewhere to dump those Poles, so he proposed that Germans be moved west & the Poles be moved west. Roosevelt was dying in 1945 - he was easily outmaneuvered by Stalin. By the Potsdam Conference in the summer of 1945 Churchill had lost power and had to leave the conference early, and Truman was tied down by Roosevelt's commitments, so Stalin got his way again.

"Request for reconsideration: Deletion of Bullshido.net entry Requesting you re-examine the arguments in [], as per WP:DRV. Your summary of my argument is factually false. My argument was that the addition of four [more [reliable sources should carry weight. The statement that the Real Fighter article was not neutral based upon some colorful language suggests your inexperience with publications about mixed martial arts. Also, you gave us no time whatever to contact Sean Treanor and learn more from him; in any case, an article hosted on Stanford's Graduate Program in Journalism webpage, and not on a student's personal website within stanford.edu, could hardly have failed to undergo peer review or professorial supervision. Furthermore, regarding the Real Fighter article, , the President of the American Sambo Association, took time out of his day to inform the discussion about how the article got produced: My name is Stephen Koepfer and I wrote the original Bullshido article/investigation on Geraci. I wanted to share my account regarding how the RF acticle came into being, since my name has come up here. Sacha Feinman, a noted journalist http://www.linkedin.com/pub/sacha-feinman/17/400/976 contacted me about writing an article about Geraci. He was, as any good journalist would be, concerned with not simply regurgitating our investigation. However, reading my article, he felt it was well written, ivestigated, etc. He felt it would be a good springboard for further investigation. So, I provided all my sources to Feinman. He vetted the entire Bullshido piece, found it to be verifiable, and continued to investigate the case in further directions which Bullshido had not covered. As Feinman noted himself it was the Bullshido article which formed the basis for his own further investigation. Feinman and I did not collaborate on his article, other than my making introductions to sources and the subject, Geraci. Feinman was not paid by Bullshido, nor is he even a member of the site. He came to us because of our notability. I fail to see how the RF article, regardless of how much or little it sepcifically mentions Bullshido in print, could not be considered a notable reference for Bullshido. Our ivnestigation served as the springboard for his, he came to us because of our notability, he personally stated this as such, and the subject of the investigation itself (Geraci) is quoted in the RF article as saying the Bullshido investigation was accurate. This addresses both the neutrality and the reliability issues, and you didn't mention it in your summary. Nor did you mention Carol Kaur's well-reasoned argument, which contained novel points to which no one had a reasonable answer. The only policies on which you seemed to be amenable to a flexible reading were those involving the definition of consensus. If Bullshido's similarity to an epithet is no grounds for considering its lack of coverage in a different light, neither are the repeated calls for deletion a basis on which to go with an impossibly loose definition of consensus. I respectfully submit that your summary of consensus was factually wrong on several points, and ask you to reconsider.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Note that it's not defined as a part of Serbia, but the Union rather. This is mostly because they anticipated the future most probable status of Kosovo, a state within the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro.

However, Kosovo is nowhere treated as an entity indistinct from Serbia (and most definatly not indistinct from the S-M), as no faction in the world sees it that way.

Also note there is some discussion at Talk:Piano_Sonata_No._16_(Mozart) about how subdominant recaps were not that uncommon amongst lesser known composers of the day... it was something Haydn never did and Mozart did very rarely.

"Re-listing of Victoria Cross I have deleted the section under this heading that read: ‘Twenty-seven years after Murphy's death, in July 1920, the rules for the Victoria Cross award were changed to exclude forfeiture. The eight extant forfeits—including that of Murphy—were then re-listed in the Victoria Cross register’. The statement is in error and there was no reference to support the statement although similar statements have been made in respect to all the forfeited awards. The VC warrant was not changed in July 1920 to exclude forfeitures. The present VC warrant still contains a forfeiture clause although the wording was modified in 1931. Since the original warrant in 1856, the monarch has had the power to restore a forfeited award but such power has never been exercised. The claim that the eight awards were relisted in the Victoria Cross Registrar refers to the War Office Alphabetical list of Victoria Cross recipients last issued in 1953. The names of the eight recipients who forfeited their awards are listed in that publication but their names were never deleted from earlier lists. Instead, both the 1920 list and the 1953 list include a note at the end of the list stating that the following 'whose names are included in the previous list forfeited the Victoria Cross under authority of the Royal Warrant quoted in each case’.",0,0,0,0,0,0

""" OneGuy's vanadalism of the discussion page Aside from OneGuy deleting other user's comments, he has now begun to blatently disorganize and effectively vanadalize people's comments: he distrupting the flow of users' comments by arbitrarily cutting off paragraphs and inserting his comments in between, instead of being civil and adding his reply to the end of a given post. Combined with his ceasless personal attacks, false accusations, and insistance on making wikipedia a propoganda machine for Islamist apologetics of the blackest kind, his behaviour has become completely intolerable, and I do not see any point in constantly refuting the same false accusations and false assertions over and over again. OneGuy must be ejected from this discussion before it can have any hope of being a civiled and productive debate. I am left with no choice but to completely resign from this discussion, since it seems that no one is going to be moderating OneGuy's behaviour anytime soon. Pename What's ironic is that OneGuy claims he is not a muslim and therefore can not be considered an Islamic apologist! In fact, most of the Muhammad/Islam apologists here claim to not be Muslim! Looks like Muhammad's best friends are the infidels. As of moderating OneGuy's behavior, the Arbitrators are looking into him and myself after he filed a hypocritical arbitration request against me and I thus filed a countercomplaint against OneGuy. Whenever OneGuy spots someone who doesn't agree with his radical apologistic viewpoint he tries to silence them by any means at his disposal. OneGuy, in his complaint in arbitration, accused me of rivert(sic) wars and having POV in my contributions yet he does the exact same thing, only more so. In the arbitration complaint, the arbitrators don't seem as concerned about the POV contributions as they do about personal attacks, revert wars and my vandalism of his user page. See Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/168.209.97.34. When OneGuy was giving evidence against me he incorrectly called a few minor word changes as a revert war (even though the change were only made once or twice) and he clearly left out the revert wars in which he was involved (but the arbitrators were not fooled - they found him out). Since the arbitrators will probably not do anything about his radical apologistic contributions, they will most likely respond to his vandalism of the talk pages. Feel free to post your complaints regarding OneGuy on Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/168.209.97.34/Evidence. 06:56, 9 Dec 2004 (UTC) Since when replying on talk page has become vandalism?

Pename has ignored what we are discussing and is resorting to personal insults and false accusations (in violation of wiki policy) that I vandalized the talk page. He now claims that he did not copy the verse from anti-Islamic site. If true, where did he find the interpretation that 8:67 means kill prisoners of war? He implied that interpretation in the article. At worst, the verse condemns the behavior of taking prisoners in order to make money, but he has not given his source that says 8:67 means kill prisoners. Instead of answering where he found that interpretation (if not anti-Islamic site), Pename is resorting to personal insults and outright lies that I vandalized the talk page 18:46, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC) Abuse Due warning: every time our anonymous friend makes a personal attack, I'm removing it.

"This is the armeniapedia version about the battle In violation of the Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty with soviet Russia, Turkish troops crossed the border in 1918 and attacked Alexandropol (Leninakan). The aggressor intended to crush Eastern Armenia and seize Transccaucasia. When Alexandropol fell, the Turkish Army poured into the Ararat Valley – the heart of Armenia. There was a major engagement at Sardarabad on May 22-26, where the Turkish Army was defeated and retreated. First of all I do not know how to revert. I just make changes. Second as I am trying to put this version, a very good guy, named roob323 reverts to an older Turkish version of the site. Moreover, now it sounds even ridiculous.The same thing they wrote twice. Just by cutting and pasting from the history of the article. These kids who never went to school in Armenia, whose knowledge about Armenian history comes from church sunday schools write things that can couse laugh even in Turkish readers. For example, in early May recently becamed independent Armenia was attacked by Ottoman forces ( Armenia Georgia and Azerbaijan decalred their independence only in the end of May). Or, after losing the battle of Sardarapat, Armenia declared its independence (second time as a matter of fact). But we all know that the second time Armenia declared its Sovetization (occupation by bolsheviks) on November 29,1920 and not independence. It is very well known that the commander in the battle of Sardarapat was Daniel Bek Pirumov from the village of Nakhichevanik in Nagorno Karabakh. SO fat these 2 imbeciles named Nareklm and roob keep pushing the name Slkuni or Silician. And finall,y who needs the aftermath of the battle in Sardarapat if it concludes information about what Georgia did, who it asked for help etc etc etc. I am surprized to find out from the article edited by roob and narek that Turkish army occupied the whole Armenia(including Russian part which is todays Armenia). Probably Nagorno Karabakh or Zangezur or Sevan they do not consider a part of Armenia anymore. Moreover, in the history of this article also edited by some turks and Narek you can find out that Armenia was forced to sign treaty of Batumi!!!!!You can see how come 3 not literate (angraget in Armenian) imbeciles can come and do things in wikipedia that Turkish and Azeri propagandists could not even see in their dreams. Because these 3 imbeciles have got a right to revert edit or even block others, the real Armenian history specialists can get heart attacks if they read this article.

"You're mixing apples and oranges: historical scholarship is not required for Wikipedia to add information, say, on a claim to the Bosnian throne. (Sorry no one has claimed the Croatia's yet). To add that information to the list of many other claimants around the world does not require approval from the pope, but it does reqire that the claimant has (A) in fact made the claim, and that (B) news sources reported on it that are considered respectable in that country. Since the news source we're talking about here are online, Alexa is the criterion for their as any other online ranking of news portals because their high position in Alexa means high readership. In the news business, this is how you measure success.

I cited it to explain to why I used that imagery in the WP:PA, as otherwise it would appear inexplicably random. The explanation was not, as you seem to think, offered in mitigation. Indeed my original unblock request, which I condensed at the request of admin Hersfold, stated: The following will help the reviewing admin(s) to understand what otherwise would appear to be a random choice of metaphors.[...] Killer has a picture of a pop-eyed chihuahua dog on her user page, captioned “I look like this”; and she is in the habit of referring to herself, in her sysopping summaries, as a dog e.g. “Puppy has spoken.” Stupidly I exploited this canine imagery at Killer’s expense.'' I edited out that section along with others in an effort to comply with Hersfold's request. My unblock request in no way implies that it is 'somehow OK to insult' you because you refer to yourself as 'puppy'. It simply explains where the idea for the canine imagery came from. It does not attempt to excuse my using it to insult you. I have apologised, and still do, for my rude and offensive references to you personally in the WP:PA; and ask that you graciously accept my apology as sincere, which it is. """,1,0,0,0,0,0

"""==Ugly Personal Attacks - You Approve??== '''Good Morning, Philippe. The post above yours, by LoverofArt, is typical of his posts in my direction. An ugly personal attack, by a person who has in essence defamed a widely respected organization the National Civilian Community Corps by posting false and misleading information at the Wikipedia website. If your / Wikipedia's best idea is that what should happen next is that I enter into a prolonged dialogue with that person, hoping to reason with him/her, while he/she continues to exert control over content and issue ugly diatribes, then your processes leave a great deal to be desired. A responsible adult a real Editor should have interceded long ago. He/she and the others working over the NCCC text at this time seem to feel that any statement introduced by the phrase """"According to ___,"""" does not belong at Wikipedia. As I read it, there was objection at one of your pages to placing references at the end of that phrase rather than at the end of the quotation. Why an encyclopedia would have as a policy including bald claims (as if fact) without reference to the source in its text eludes me. It would give the impression that the encyclopedia had evaluated the statement, which is obviously not the case. I appreciate Wikipedia's effort to provide freely accessible information to the public. I am not impressed, however, by the response to gross errors made at the Wikipedia site. Your crew is attacking the messenger at least in part because it is the message that it does not like. A pretty sorry performance, which you seem to be joining by failing to address the issues I raise or the attacks on me. Pull LoverofArt out of this situation and I will join in a dispute resolution process regarding editing the NCCC site. I refuse to have further dealings with him/her. """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I think I may have a fundamentally different understanding of that section than you guys do, or than the community at large might. I personally found List of cetaceans to be handy in the past. Its seems like to me that people doing research would be able to do it more easily if they have access to more information in the form of more obvious, suggested links, that will help people hop from page to page. I don’t think that people are going to be approaching these animals en mass, usually. They will look at one animal, and if there is a link there, like List of cetaceans, or Cetacean Conservation Center, they will have a very easy, RECOMMENDED, “in” to do more research, and learn about what amazing creatures these are. Clicking these links in a see also section really helped me, personally, to have access to information which lead me to love these particular marine mammals, and I want other people to have more opportunities to get more information. I think List of cetaceans should be included because cetaceans links to a different page. I would like to see Cetacean Conservation Center go in, but I understand if my fellow wikipedians find that to be redundant. I can see why Dolphin Research Center is redundant after a while. I think these two links would be helpful for a person looking at only one animal, but I can see why they might be redundant if people are looking at many dolphins. Should these be included? What about Marine Biology, could that be included? There are things link linking The Cove (film) to dolphins that exist in the costal waters of Japan that I really think should be included because is discusses an issue critical to the preservation of the species.

Except for WP:AN & it's mate WP:AN/I, & intermittently on the WikiEN-l mailling list, I don't know where this is being discussed. Maybe also at Wikipedia:Village Pump. And, IMHO, those fora appear to be full of people who are against fair use entirely, so they may not listen to an opposing voice. I find this whole campaign against any fair use materials discouraging although sometimes I am too pessimistic about things, both related to Wikipedia or not. The rule as long as I've contributed to Wikipedia is that non-free materials may be used specifically to help identify its subjects. Examples would include the flag logo with Microsoft Windows, or the """"death star"""" logo with AT&T; (to name 2 US-centric ones). How else would one identify the Led Zeppelin album with the weird runes that some people label """"ZOZO""""? Beyond that, the rules become fuzzy very quickly (e.g., can one use a screencap to help identify significant commercials?), & I simply feel that those cases are not worth the effort to del with. (To give another example, I have a book or two that were published in the mid-1960s in Ethiopia at which time, from what I've been able to determine, the country had no functional copyright law.

""" Question about Edit Where is the proper place to put forth an individual and allow his talents to be fully utilized? Would you suggest I use the edited text as the basis for an RFA? Surely any poly-degreed Oxforder with 18,000 edits in 22 months can be, indeed is, a formidable Wikipedian exerting a vast influence on the quality and tone of the project. Here is the meat of the text - I would appreciate any guidance you might be willing to offer: I think this project could possibly use the help of the Editor . He has not one, but Two, degrees from Oxford - has written several books [Love Songs and Other Mysteries (1991) - Bad Choice (1989) - Sorry, No ISBN numbers exist to link to ...] and has made just a hair under Eighteen Thousand edits in 22 months at Wiki. As he has frequently invoked the """"Superior Authority"""" of his multiple Oxford degrees and education and on numerous occasions brandished his Oxon academic honors to defend and enshrine his edits in Wikipedia and to eliminate the need for discussion, perhaps he could be of some use here - building the entry for his alma mater. Surely an American 'emergency responder', author, 18,000 count wiki Editor, and pedigreed intellectual with the rare accomplishment of two Oxford post graduate degrees would be of special use to the project. """"With respect, I went to Oxford, so i am fairly well aware of Brit English...penultimate being the climax of the story."""" - Arcayne """"Regarding the 'penultimate' stuff - not worries - as I said, it's just a word. I always thought is was used as next to the end, as in right before the ending. A slightly different meaning has become popular, like how the original phrase """"buck naked"""" (meaning, naked as a male deer) becoming mispronounced so often that now people say """"butt-naked"""". It would render me a crabby old man to decry the loss of the word meanings. It was also make me something of a jerk. Words evolve. - Arcayne 14:34, 3 July 2008"""" """"I did attend Oxford. I did graduate from there with the two degrees I have previously noted"""" - Arcayne These are the two degrees Arcayne previously noted: the EU is not a single nation, nor is the UN or UAE. They are actually something called NGO's, or non-governmental organizations. - Arcayne The EU is nothing BUT a governmental organization. Its purpose is to politically unite the countries within the European Community. ... it is a united entity. Ditto the UAE. Kapowow Are you seriously trying to suggest that the EU is not an NGO? ... If you consider me throwing my political science and international relations degrees at you to be derogatory, then I have to say that I am sorry you feel that way. I am not a potted plant; I know the policies of which I speak,' ... - Arcayne''' I trust the Project will be the better, as has Wikipedia in general, with such a confident and industrious Oxonian on board. Surely Wikipedia, or the Oxford community, have a place for those such as Arcayne, who are able to place 18,000 edits in 22 months as the very public face of Oxford Wikipedians.75.57.205.135 """,0,0,0,0,0,0

You the hell listens to storm front. Oh my god Wikipedia is becomeing a dumping ground for neo-nazis and altra lefties. Since I am the voice of reason. I just have to say one thing. Pleas read my reply to storm front. Here it is - Okay okay. Lats just get the fatcs right. This is what some nazi said on storm front """" Peter Watson (of Warwick, Qld.) has claimed to represent all sorts of groups, and - in forums - likes to pretend he is several people at the same time. He has a habit of claiming to be the President of organisations he has made up on the internet. He says he is 14 (or 16) years old."""" Answere:- No I have not supported lotsd of groups. I have only supported the CPW , AWP (formally known as the NCPA). I was never a member of the People's Think Tank Association plus the PTTA never had a president. Plus I have only ever been one person. And that person is Peter Watson. This nazi must have a lot of time on his hands to look for information on me. So I can only come up with only one conclusion and that is simply that this man has no social or sex life. So I can only say on thing """"go get a life man and get a women"""". Peter was President of the """"People's Think Tank Association"""" based in Warwick, which he says """"split from the Communist Party of Australia just recently and they publish the Caller"""" Answere:- I was never the president of the PTTA. The PTTA was never ever created. The Caller was a fake news paper. As fare as I know it was only ever printed once by some nazi. Since the PTTA was never realy so how cna it split from the CPA. So many questions and not enough answeres. The man just doesn't have a life. Peter was """"President of the New Communist Party of Australia"""" and """"Chairman of the Central Committee"""" (this is in his Communist International News) Answere:- I was the president but not the had of the NCPA. I was the chairman of the central commitee. But as you might know the NCPA and the AWP are the same group. The AWP change its name to NCPA but change it's name back soon after remember you stupid nazi. Peter was """"President of the Communist Party of Warwick"""" Answere:- Only for a short number of times in the hsitory fot he party that I was the presidnet of it. Peter also says: """"the New Communist Party of Australia (NCPA) , The People Think Tank Association (PTTA) and the Communist Socialist Workers Front (CSWF) did dissolve and absorbed into the Australia First Party (AFP)"""". Answere:- The Communist Socialist Worker's Front never ever was created and never was real. It just goes to show that nazis just makes things up to help them selvs. The PTTA was never real. If you are aksing why I made the CSWF and the PTTA up well it was just for fun. Peter has also set up the """"Australian Worker's Party"""" Answere:- This nazi (FairDinkum) is a idiot. I have said this many times that it was started in april was a split from the CPW that changed it's name to NCPA than change it's name back to AWP when it was kicked out fo the AFP. Not only are nazis stupid like FairDinkum but they also don't listen. I am a Communist and believe in Marxist-Leninism. I am not retarted. Plus I am not troubled person or retarted.

""" It says to use secondary sources primarily, not exclusively. Besides it being a rather obvious, observable fact that the new street lights are brighter, we have a reference in that they were claimed to be 'safer' (i.e., provide more light). The fact that light pollution is increased with increased brightness is non-arguable, it'd be like saying you have to prove the sun is generally brighter at mid-day. Light pollution has to do with the amount of light used. Newer street light technology produces more light with less energy. The less energy part is great, it's the more light that has to do with light pollution. How's this: In 2011, the City announced plans to upgrade 80% of its street lighting to new energy-efficient street lights which use induction technology, a modified form of fluorescent lamp that produces a broader spectrum than sodium-vapor lamps. The new system is predicted to save $2.2 million per year in energy and maintenance costs [37], and was proposed to """"make our neighborhoods safer"""" [37] by producing more light, something that also increases [light pollution], while lowering [visual comfort probability]. Wikipedia. Retrieved February 7, 2014. In 2014, San Diego announced plans to become the first U.S. city to install cyber-controlled street lighting, using an """"intelligent"""" lighting system to control 3,000 LED street lights.[38] ..(Side Note) I found several non-local references while searching for 'street lights controversy', one claimed a battle was 'raging' in communities across the nation, in places that were making the switch to brighter street lighting. It seems to mostly involve people calling and complaining - Complaints in San Diego held back further instillations along Harbor Drive, and the PR person I talked to said he had dealt with tons of complaints; And that was at an early stage of the upgrade. There's also a battle in Sacramento being waged to keep incandescent bulbs from being completely phased out (I wouldn't be surprised if it's not widely covered by the media), because they haven't come up with a non-toxic energy saving bulb (There actually was one being developed, and now I can't find any information about it).

""" Orbit of the Moon So apparently there are some sources that describe the Moon's orbit as convex, and some that describe it as concave. People have a tendency to mix up the terms convex and concave. Damn whatever idiot decided to use such similar words for such an obscure concept. Rather than attempt to determine which sources have more authority, I suggest we look at the actual definitions of the words. All the sources agree that the Moon's orbit has no loops. And the Wikipedia article Convex and concave polygons seems to imply that a circle without loops would be convex, rather than concave. Some of the sources describe it as convex/concave inwards vs. convex/concave outwards. I think that distinction is nonsense. Something is either convex or concave. Convexity and concavity have no distinction with respect to inwards or outwards. When they say that the Moon's orbit is convex """"with respect to the Sun"""" I think they just mean that as opposed to convex with respect to the Earth. So I still think I'm right on this, and I'm not inclined to change my edit. Except maybe to link to the article on the definition of convex, to avoid this misunderstanding in the future.

""" I've noticed that as well. That's actually what confuses me the most: If it really is a single, why can't I buy it anywhere? Honestly, I think that if people write it as a """"single"""", they don't really care if it isn't available separately; simply calling something a single doesn't specify whether it's promo or not. For people trying to cater to consumers, like Billboard.com reviews, if it's a popular hit and/or music video, people know it; it doesn't matter under what technical details it was released. But I think the difference is that since we are able to specify this, we probably should. We should try to reflect the reality. I don't think having a music video and a high placement in charts does anything to change the type of single it is; I've seen music videos for promo singles many times before; even some for album tracks. Isn't it a promo single nevertheless if it's only available separate from the album for promotional purposes? It's not like this is degrading the single in any way either; some artists just don't release subsequent album singles separately for consumers because they'd rather prefer they buy the album.

"Yes, but how is this actually relevant to whether it belongs in the article? I think you think that the content being there is somehow an endorsement of the Daily Mail. It isn't, it is a mere documentation that allegations of special stage management were part of the controversy, and they were subsequently shown to be rubbish. I see no merit in not mentioning it simply because it was the Daily Mail, or that is was rubbish. I am sure if its really necessary this theme could be supported by better sources, but the Daily Mail was just the most obvious example I came across at the time.

It's almost as if the admin community had some vestigial shame on how that ANI was handled, why else suppress it by removing the questions from the candidates pages? I have been advised not to make edits to articles if I wish my ArbCom case page to be regarded as timeous, then you say I'm, """"not even trying to build articles anymore"""". However I regarded ArbCom elections, and editing WP:AGF - , , as exceptions. As was my WP:AGF talk page participation. If I was going to re-write the satire, I would satirise the admin behaviour it was aimed at by comparison to the mindset of the religious police of the Iranian state. The religious police are to Islam and the Koran as some admins are to Wikipedia and it's Policies and Guidelines. You can draw further parallels with conservative and liberal wings among admins, but no one likes an extremest. If you don't like that comparison then compare them with the mindset of US soldiers at Abu Ghraib. Over-the-top comparisons? Remember I'm talking about mindset here; but given the chance, how many admins would you expect to behave as abhorrently as the religious police? Now take that answer and multiply by three. If the product is greater than zero, then you must have thought of at least one admin who you would expect to abuse others human rights if they had real powers in the real world. Don't you think that these admins should have the tools gently removed from their hands? Part of the humour of the was the alternative spelling of Constable to Cunstable - not very subtle humour & a very minor part near the end, but obviously intended as humour, and read with good faith can only be regarded as such - however this was used as a pretext to speedy delete after 5 hours in WP:MFD. was put up with the Brainstorming template from the first, indicating an appeal for participation in it's production and alteration, as someone did when it was in WP:Namespace. If the cited reason of """"calling admins cunts by typographic means"""" was the only objection, then it would have been quite easy to participate and call for those changes. Instead of participation, admins afraid of satire, suppressed the satire rather than examine the underlying concern the piece was obviously addressing - WP:religious police, another satire anyone? I would remind you of the story of Dickens being sued by some gentlemen over Oliver Twist, citing that the book used their person as the basis for the poorhouse character who refused Oliver's request for more (despite it being politely put; I know how he feels), the judge summed up that anyone who saw themselves in that character wasn't up to much (I paraphrase). If you felt you were being targeted by my satire, then I would ask which character from Oliver you think the general readership would regard you as. I trust that my useful, and still standing, contributions to WP:AGF, and for the other rebuttals of your given reasons for the block, you will change your view to one which I hold myself - I am here to build an encyclopaedia; and lift the block.

""" Ceiling fan article edit Thanks for your recent contrib to the ceiling fan article. It's good when people edit things, because it sparks thought in new directions. I admire the originality of your thought, and the level of observance required to note such a detail as a fan's usefulness in humid versus dry climates. Howeverand I mean this in an amusing way, rather than offensivelyyou were totally wrong. The statement about a fan's usefulness in dry versus humid climates was, in fact, not backwards. This is how the statement read before you edited it: """"Since a fan creates its cooling effect by speeding the evaporation of moisture on human skin, its perceived usefulness is directly correlated with the amount of humidity (moisture) in the room. In dry environments, such as desert climates, a fan has a lesser perceived usefulness than in humid environments; this is especially notable during cold weather, where a humid environment has a pronounced wind-chill effect which is lacking in dry environments."""" You said, in your edit summary, to refer to the heat index article. So I did. The introductory paragraph to that article reads: """"The human body normally cools itself by perspiration, or sweating, in which the water in the sweat evaporates and carries heat away from the body. However, when the relative humidity is high, the evaporation rate of water is reduced. This means heat is removed from the body at a lower rate, causing it to retain more heat than it would in dry air."""""""" ...thus proving that my original statement in my ceiling fan article was correct. In humid climates, heat is naturally removed from the body at a lower rate than in dry climates, causing a person to remain hotter longer than in dry climates. Thus, there is a greater need for a fan than in desert climatesthus it is perceived as being more useful. I saw, via your userpage, that you've grown up in New York. I'm originally from the east coast myself, and I lived here my whole life save for two years in Utaha very distinct desert climate. The lack of humidity out there is actually quite a pleasure. In the summer there, it can be 105 degrees and feel no hotter than 85 here on the east coastyou look at the thermometer there and say """"Wow, I didn't realize it's over 100this isn't that uncomfortable!"""". I wasn't dying for a fan there, the way I do here. Also, the converse is truethe winters out there are more bearable than they are here. They don't seem as cold, because the humidity is really what adds the """"bone-chilling"""" factor into the mix. Anyhow, I've reverted your edit to the ceiling fan article.

"""::::I'm delighted that you are finally looking at the sources. Now we can make some progress. You did well to spot the other ref in Ptolemy to the FINNI. This confirms my suggestion above that there were 2 groups of FINNI - one in N Scandinavia and one somewhere E of the Vistula. They may or may not have been related: as I explained earlier, the same name is not conclusive evidence of ethnic affiliation. For example, the northern group may have been proto-Sami, while the southern group may have been proto-Finns. Anyway, we can't show the northern group as their habitat is off the map. The question now is where the southern group was located. I have to admit that your suggestion of the upper Vistula region is a more natural reading of Ptolemy III.5. However, it conflicts with the most natural reading of Tacitus G.46, which is that the VENEDI were between the FENNI and the BASTARNAE and I am using Tacitus as the """"default"""" position in this map. I want to do some more research on this one. But one possible compromise is that we could show them in both places with a ? after the name. """,0,0,0,0,0,0

""" Cleanstart Hey there. I wanted to talk to you about your cleanstart. As a cleanstart account myself, I figured I'd give you some pointers. First, take some time off between retiring from the old account and creating the new one. I recommend six months. I took well over half a year off, although I know people who have waited only three months or so, so really, it's up to you. The reason that this is suggested is that it a) allows you to cool off from any disputes, and b) you don't get caught immediately in the cleanstart. Second, don't work in the new account in the same place you worked before you retired. This prevents all sorts of ethical issues, and again, it prevents you from getting caught immediately. Third, once you do come back, shoot an email off to ArbCom. This protects you from being called a sockpuppet if people link the accounts later. You might also consider telling Tiptoey and MuZemike, the two most active CUs, again by email. They're both trustworthy. If you don't think you can do any of those three things, a cleanstart might not be for you. Consider the virtues of apologizing for whatever you've done wrong and working on improving. Most of us are pretty forgiving, and apologizes (genuine, unforced ones) are so rare that they're still cherished around here. Cheers, and good luck, Wha? """,0,0,0,0,0,0

""" The Truth about the 1986 Sinn Féin Ard Fheis and the Unbroken Continuity of Sinn Féin Poblachtach since 1905 The story of how Gerry Adams tried to turn an eighty year old revolutionary movement into a British Constitutional party. How he broke the Sinn Féin constitution, created fake cumainn to give him fake votes and barred life long republicans from voting. How he managed to expel himself and his supporters from Sinn Féin membership. And, how a small band of republicans managed to keep the Sinn Féin constitution and traditional policy in tact. In 1986 Section 1b. of the Sinn Féin constitution read as follows: “No person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who, if elected, intend taking part in the proceedings of the Westminster or partitionist 26-County or 6-County parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions, shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership."""" The Adams leadership put forward a motion, titled Resolution 162, at the 1986 Ard Fheis. Its wording was as follows: RESOLUTION 162 THAT this Ard-Fheis drops its abstentionist attitude to Leinster House. Successful Sinn Fein parliamentary candidates in 26-County elections: a. Shall attend Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle. b. Shall not draw their salaries for personal use. (Parliamentary representatives shall be paid a Sinn Fein organiser’s subsidy, and the Leinster House salary shall be divided at the direction of the Ard Chomhairle to defray national and constituency expenses.) To accommodate this change, the Constitution and Rules be amended as follows: That Section 1b of the Constitution be amended to read: No person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who, if elected, intend taking part in the proceedings of the Westminster or partitionist 6-County parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions, shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership. Motion 162 supports and approves of the candidature of persons who, if elected, would be of the intention to take their seats in certain circumstances i.e. on the direction of the Ard Chomhairle. Obviously, Motion 162 infringes Section 1b. Section 1b. was in effect at the time this Resolution was presented. Its clear that Adams made a mistake in procedure. He should have sought a majority decision to amend Section 1b. in 1986 and returned in 1987 to propose entering Leinster House. Trying to amend Section 1b. and propose taking seats in the “partitionist 26-County Parliament” in the same Resolution was a logical impossibility. Can anybody say that the wording: “That this Ard-Fheis drops its abstentionist attitude to Leinster House. Successful Sinn Fein parliamentary candidates in 26-County elections: a. Shall attend Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle” does not constitute the supporting and approving of the candidature of persons who intend to take their seats in Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle? Clearly Adams was in breach of Section 1b. and according to that section he had expelled himself, and all those who voted for Resolution 162. Brian Feeney, in his book, Sinn Féin 100 Turbulent Years, puts forward the argument that Adams had managed to bypass Section 1b, by introducing a motion in 1983 allowing the “discussion” of any aspect of the Sinn Féin constitution. This change may indeed have facilitated debate on abstentionism but it did not infringe on the content or effect of Section 1b in any way. To discuss something is not the same as formally proposing or supporting it. For example, conventions are held regularly where drug addiction is discussed without any of the delegates proposing or supporting it. In fact the line Adams added in 1983 was superfluous, as the Sinn Féin constitution had never banned the “discussion” of anything – just the “approving” and “supporting” of taking seats in named partitionist parliaments. Of course its not illegal to amend or remove section 1b. Section 1b. bans the approval or support of candidates who intend to take seats in British assemblies. It can be removed or amended at any Ard Fheis by a two thirds majority. The reason for doing so could be many. Perhaps delegates might feel that it implies that they cannot be trusted to be loyal to the Republic. In fact its not necess",0,0,0,0,0,0

False statement A continuous random variable does not always have a density. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 194.4.140.135 Definition I dont like the definition here, not that I'm letting my ignorance of stats stop me from commenting, but could this be considered a clearer definition?: """"Random Variable The outcome of an experiment need not be a number, for example, the outcome when a coin is tossed can be 'heads' or 'tails'. However, we often want to represent outcomes as numbers. A random variable is a function that associates a unique numerical value with every outcome of an experiment. The value of the random variable will vary from trial to trial as the experiment is repeated. There are two types of random variable - discrete and continuous. A random variable has either an associated probability distribution (discrete random variable) or probability density function (continuous random variable). I think this is definitely an improvement but it should be pointed out that there exists r.v.'s which are neither discrete nor continuous (for example take the sum of one r.v. of each type) The current definition is bad in that it is neither clear to the lay reader nor specific to the technical reader. The above definition is far better on both counts and so I will put it on the page. BTW, sorry about the no summary edit, I hit the enter key accidentally. Examples A coin is tossed ten times. The random variable X is the number of tails that are noted. X can only take the values 0, 1, ..., 10, so X is a discrete random variable. A light bulb is burned until it burns out. The random variable Y is its lifetime in hours. Y can take any positive real value, so Y is a continuous random variable. """" I think the above definition (for the original reference, pls search via google) explains to me that it is a mapping between a value and the sequence number of that value, rather like a numeric index to a database record. This would appear to allow greater generalization in statistical definitions and algorithms. The earler Wikiedia definition led me to comment on another Wikipedia definition incorrectly because I think I may have misunderstood the concept after looking at this Wikipedia definition. A random variable is a function that assigns a numerical value to an event. This example: just assigns another event to an event. Could we change it to something like: Consider a game where if a 6 is rolled on a fair six-sided die, player 1 wins, and otherwise, player 2 wins. Let X represent the number of times player 1 wins. Then and or maybe include an example of a continuous random variable? What do you think? This section should begin with a sentence of the form """"A random variable is ..."""".

His willingness to discuss puts him well above the bar of the usual self promoter. and he's not pushing his only publications as viable sources nor is he unwilling to seek consensus.

Look for you self: Espionage or a dick spying on some pussy lovers involves an individual obtaining information that is considered secret or confidential without the permission of the holder of the information. Espionage is inherently clandestine, as the legitimate holder of the information may change plans or take other countermeasures once it is known that the information is in unauthorized hands. See clandestine HUMINT for the basic concepts of such information collection, and subordinate articles such as clandestine HUMINT operational techniques and clandestine HUMINT asset recruiting for discussions of the """"tradecraft"""" used to collect this information. Hey I gotta joke and it goes like this:Dick says """"Hey Balls get ready for a patry"""" Balls replies """"You fucking liar. Everytime we go to a party, you always go in and leave us out here knockin. History Incidents of espionage are well documented throughout history. The ancient writings of Chinese and Indian military strategists such as Sun-Tzu and Chanakya contain information on deception and subversion. Chanakya's student Chandragupta Maurya, founder of the Maurya Empire, made use of assassinations, spies and secret agents, which are described in Chanakya's Arthasastra. The ancient Egyptians had a thoroughly developed system for the acquisition of intelligence, and the Hebrews used spies as well, as in the story of Rahab. Feudal Japan often used ninja to gather intelligence. More recently, spies played a significant part in Elizabethan England (see Francis Walsingham). Many modern espionage methods were well established even then. http://www.henrywotton.org.uk/ The Cold War involved intense espionage activity between the United States of America and its allies and the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and their allies, particularly related to nuclear weapons secrets. Recently, espionage agencies have targeted the illegal drug trade and those considered to be terrorists. Different intelligence services value certain intelligence collection techniques over others. The former Soviet Union, for example, preferred human sources over research in open sources, while the United States has tended to emphasize technological methods such as SIGINT and IMINT. Both Soviet political (KGB) and military intelligence (GRU ) officers were judged by the number of agents they recruited. Various Forms Unlike other forms of intelligence collection disciplines, espionage usually involves accessing the place where the desired information is stored, or accessing the people who know the information and will divulge it through some kind of subterfuge. There are exceptions to physical meetings, such as the Oslo Report, or the insistence of Robert Hanssen in never meeting the people to whom he was selling information. The US defines espionage towards itself as """"The act of obtaining, delivering, transmitting, communicating, or receiving information about the national defense with an intent, or reason to believe, that the information may be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation. Espionage is a violation of 18 United States Code 792-798 and Article 106, Uniform Code of Military Justice{{cite web | last = US Department of Defense | authorlink = U.S. Department of Defense | title = Joint Publication 1-02 Department of Defe",1,0,1,0,1,0

"Explanation My revdeleted comment was a bad-tempered response to a deliberately needling statement from someone who has a bit of history when it comes to doling out such statements. I explained this when contacted by on Sunday, in my message to him at 10:32 UTC. I emphasised that my words were figurative and in the context of what had been said by the other contributor. I also asked Philippe to reassure that contributor of various things, including that I know nothing about them, that I neither have nor have access to any weapons beyond the sort of thing usually found in a UK home, and that there was no intent to do anything in particular except leave in utter frustration of the bad faith etc flying around. I assume that message had been passed on by around 19:55 UTC latest, which is when Philippe replied to me. I haven't looked at Wikipedia since that bad-tempered retort and would not have looked at it now if it were not for someone asking me to post some sort of comment. I'm not reading through the stuff above, nor looking at the ANI thread that I'm told was opened. Until certain things happen, some on-wiki and some involving an issue that the WMF are looking at off-wiki, I'm gone from here. I'm pretty sure that those certain things will happen but I doubt that they will do so soon, and it may be that I decide not to return anyway. Frankly - and I know this will seem arrogant - that would be Wikipedia's loss, not mine. If/when I do return, I'll be notifying quite a few people that I would rather they stayed away from my talk page, which is something I've always been reluctant to do in the past.

The gang can go elsewhere, while I hope that Eric and myself will continue to agree/agree to differ as and when appropriate and in an adult manner. We can get on with improving content; the baiters can carry on doing whatever it is they want to do elsewhere. My thanks to everyone who has contacted me.

So what you did is described here in wiki humor: Adminitis is a state of mind in which some Wikipedians find themselves at times. Though generally confined to administrators, the condition has been observed in some non-administrators. Although the exact causes are unknown, there is thought to be some correlation towards extensive and prolonged anti-vandalism activity.Contents [show] [edit] Symptoms Strongly believes that all users are equal but admins are more equal than others Assumes bad faith frequently TLAitis (see WP:WOTTA) Stops editing articles, but continuously pontificates about """"writing the encyclopedia"""" Impatience Exhibits immediatism Hangs out in project namespace Has no time for featured articles Frequently refreshes pages to catch the latest change that (of course) needs to be reverted Believes that he or she is always right (sorry, EVula...) Believes anyone who uses the word 'vote' for 'express a view in a straw poll' should be banned for life Originally hailed as the nicest person on the wiki, now reviled as the most hated troll Prevents pages from being edited in encyclopedic fashion for policy reasons Seems to enjoy biting new users General BOFHness Strict adherence to """"Wikipedia policy"""" while not using common sense or conversely, Strict adherence to ignore all rules, as a strict rule... while not using common sense Self-denial. """"This page cannot possibly apply to me"""" Humor breakdown. """"This page is not funny"""" Sudden spike in use of specific admin tools, or use of admin tools in areas where he hadn't been using them before Requires less and less evidence to be convinced of sock puppetry until confidently asserting that all new users are the same person Spends hours writing sarcastic pages about admin behavior Believes he is the only real claimant to the """"Defender of the Wiki"""" barnstar Exhibits signs of MPOV Thinks people are attacking them when they're only trying to be nice Has a habit of removing criticism while pretending it's a personal attack Indulges in biting delicious newcomers [edit] Diagnosis It is a near universal truth that sufferers from this illness will reject any diagnosis of the condition by an outside party. With that in mind, it's important for those who have received this diagnosis to conduct a self-test. If more than three of the following apply to you, you may be suffering from this illness: You frequently feel that pages are broken and must be deleted (protection is for wusses!). """"Everyone is a vandal or a troll, and must be blocked"""" is a recurrent thought. """"Blocking people is a punishment! (not a tool to get people to cool down and edit the wiki)"""" is a mantra, not anti-wiki. If you nominate this page for MfD even though it's only 2 minutes since the last revision, you may possibly be suffering from adminitis. Corollary: If you speedy, you are certainly suffering from adminitis. If you accuse the creators of this article of making a WP:POINT, especially if you forget that making a point does not imply disruption (you need to disrupt to make a point, not make a point to disrupt! -P), you are probably infected. And if you buy the above line of thought, you are definitely infected.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

In fact, it is jokers like you that make Wikipedia an unreliable piece of crap that the world laughs on. You thought you can block users who edit articles that are wrongly written to project a """"good"""" image like that C-grade item song sleaze actress Payal Rohatgi. On the account of hello5678, when I edited to write the truth, since I work with the media and knew the actual truth, you did what you knew best - to block accounts and even have the foolish audacity to write that it did not seem I was a journalist. Your block anyways went futile ( like all your remaining blocks on other users go, and future blocks will be going ) since as I had said, there are a million computers to comment and reply from. It just depends on my wish if I want to respond to idle losers like you and whether I have the time to do so. Once and for all, I am doing it this time, and won't remove time for worthless people like you again. You had some advice on how I should spend my """"blocked time"""" by reading WP:Dispute pages on Wikipedia so that I have better ideas on dealing with disputes. Actually ,you need better ideas to deal with life. I am not foolish like you to spend any amount of my time bothering about rubbish written by stupid people like you who have no work in real life and spend days editing pages on Wikipedia/ Scribblebook that no one bothers to read. Some people are just unfortunate like you and 2over0. And if you are troubled by my calling that actress """"sleazy"""", then that's your problem. Cos that's the only work she has done and the press uses precisely that term while referencing her work. You also spoke about writing """"accurate"""" information on wikipedia. Ironic, when you don't even bother finding out what is accurate, and spend endless hours blocking, and acting admin as if it is an important position in yourCarry on with your scribble game. And if you feel threatened by media exposure, then that shows you knew you were wrong. It's only when people are wrong that they feel threatened. Pity your personality. Also, you ended by writing that """" it's clear you aren't a journalist, and have no means of carrying out your threat """" - LOL. Sad, that you lived in that illusion. For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual life. Oh wait, that may be the only position you probably have or will have ever in your unfortunate life. Carry on with your scribble game. And if you feel threatened by media exposure, then that shows you knew you were wrong. It's only when people are wrong that they feel threatened. Pity your personality. Also, you ended by writing that """" it's clear you aren't a journalist, and have no means of carrying out your threat """" - LOL. Sad, that you lived in that illusion. For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual pages on Wiki-scribble-pedia, will obviously withdraw from the truth. You yourself have no idea at all if I am a journalist, and you write that it's clear that I am not. Well, you are also inane and a clown to fool yourself. I had all means, and the said article has already been published. I had NO TIME to let you know, since I am a busy person, unlike you and do not find time to come scribble on virtual pages that clowns like you , 2OVERO, 2/0, AKERANS, MANAGERARC, FISHERQUEEN (yeah, we named you again - Suck it up), KURU etc. do all your life. You will find that information, depending on which Godforsaken part of the world you live in. And like last time, you can go ahead and block me this time too.

"Request for comment: Wikipedia article on Pottery This dispute is concerned with definitions of the term pottery and the way that differing definitions of the term should affect the content of the Pottery article. The term pottery is defined narrowly by some reputable authorities to exclude everything but pottery vessels; pots, dishes and suchlike things. Other equally reputable authorities define the term more widely, to include such things as figurines, statuettes and tiles. The question of when and where the first pottery was made is a highly contentious one in some quarters. Attempts have been made on one side to prove that the earliest pottery is that represented by ceramic figurines found in the modern-day Czech Republic, while others have sought to prove that the earliest pottery is that represented by ceramic vessels found in modern-day Japan. A protagonist in the dispute holds the firm opinion that only vessels can be pottery and from this argues that the pottery article must present without qualification the view that the Japanese vessels are the world's earliest pottery.

""" Edit 25 Nov 07 The anonymous editor immediately before me believed that they had """"deleted weasel words, tried to bring it back to a neutral perspective"""". The edit was a basic misunderstanding of the Secret History; I wouldn't be surprised if they hadn't read the work. The SH does indeed """"claim to"""" report, rather than """"report"""" scandals in Justinian's reign: the work remains completely uncorroborated by any other contemporary witness, and some of the purported scandals are so outrageous, the causes given by Procopius so bizarre and unknowable (viz., that Justinian was a devil and had the gift of invisibility), that much of it does not so much report anything as give vent to the bile of the author: that's why I let stand the deletion of """"apparently"""" (""""The Secret History apparently reveals an author who had become deeply disillusioned""""), since that particular word is a """"weasel word"""" on the part of some Wikipedia editor. But the so-called 'revelations' are indeed """"titillating (and doubtful)"""" rather than """"revealing"""" (and """"revealing revelations"""" is very bad copy editing, too). Similarly again, given that there is no doubt that the same author wrote both the SH and the Buildings, the panegyric of Justinian is undeniably insincere; since the Buildings bears the mark of official patronage in other respects, the panegyric can indeed be viewed as written at Justinian's behest, or something like it: stet.

No, of course you don't.

Truth is unwelcome, as is accidental or ignorant distortion. As far as Wikipedia is concerned, a Euromyth is always a deliberate calumny.

Trouble is, though, that this very large number of people is ignorant of the facts - the facts as presented by the arch-priests of this very large number of people, to wit the European Commission and its many propaganda outlets. To put it simply, any examination of any official list of Euromyths will throw up at least one Euromyth that is to myth, falsehood and misrepresentation what Plan D was to democarcy, dialogue and debatenot mythical at all.

", 4 December 2006 (UTC) The Cosmology part is not by me. I only corrected some really impossibly wrong aspects that someone inserted on a spree of misguided grandiosity. I really have only fixed false stuff, never really written anything but those pieces in the articles we did together. At one point recently (the other day) I nearly eliminated all the Cosmology section and referenced the God Speaks article instead. Then I thought that was too bold, even though that's what my heart says to do. I didn't want to do something that radical without others. But my feeling is that the God Speaks article is much better than the Cosmology section in the Meher Baba article, and that it should only appear in the God Speaks section. So my feeling is still to toss out much of the stuff on the Baba article and if there is anything good or that we missed move it to the God Speaks article. Also, if there is quarelling over these issues in the future, it won't reflect as badly on the main Meher Baba article as it will be a side article. So that's my vote.

"In an effort to avoid any future edit war, I wanted to discuss why I feel that the lead should be changed. As I've noted previously, the citations given for rap metal repeat links sourced later in the article. The reason that punk rock had been given as a genre was because it was the most commonly used term given in articles about the band, rather than rap rock, a term that is not used by the band. While it has been argued that Rolling Stone is a stronger source than some of the others, it should be noted that these reviews were written, as previously noted, during the period in which the band was signed to a major label, when the band received more coverage than it has while recording and releasing albums independently, and sources agree that the majority of the band's works (its debut EP, debut album, and all independent releases) reflect a punk influence, rather than a metal influence, and most certainly the band's most recent work is considered to be punk-influenced. Thus, taking into consideration that the majority and most recent of the band's works is considered to be punk rock, I feel that this is the genre that should be given in the lead. ( )",0,0,0,0,0,0

""" (deindent) Not even wrong only if you don't understand what he's doing. These are all standard problems for the many millions of people who have tried to make sense of infinite arithmetic at some point in their lives. The number ...9997 in Archimedes' system is also known as the number -3, which almost is the """"largest prime"""" in Ludwig's order on the Plutonian integers. You would think ...99998 might be the right one, but that's -2, and it is clearly divisible by two. So maybe ...9997 should be thought of as divisible by three, but dividing by three is different than dividing by two in base-10, because two divides 10 and three does not. So maybe that's a self-consistent definition in a 10-based infinite arithmetic with the order he chooses. Maybe not. I don't know, but neither do you, and to pretend otherwise is insincere. It's not incoherent, just original, and incomplete. The methodology is obviously many, many, painstaking infinite digit calculations, with the extra burden that the rules keep shifting whenever he finds an inconsistency. The reason he claims transcendental numbers are incomplete is because, if you accept that the integers are Plutonian, the real numbers are only """"finitely"""" wide. Normally, a real number can be thought of as a map from Z->digits, giving it's digit sequence. Unfortunately, Plutonium's """"Z"""" is just as large as the real numbers, so that a real number is really only a sequence of digits, because a sequence in this view cannot be viewed as a map from Z-> digits. In this view Z is larger than any sequence (the integers are """"uncountable""""). So the real numbers have """"gaps"""" which would be filled by reciprocals of infinite integers. But large integers don't have reciprocals in Plutonium's system, because he can't make any sense out of bi-infinite sequences: Numbers like ... 999123.3333..... are not allowed because you can't do multiplication digit by digit. So he doesn't think of the real numbers as containing the integers, he has two classes of numbers the """"Adic integers"""" which are infinite to the left and finite to the right, and the """"real numbers"""" which are infinite to the right and finite to the left, and it is illegal to add an adic integer and a real number. The reason Archimedes Plutonium keeps working on the Riemann Hypothesis is because he feels he can say something new about the distribution of primes because he has knowledge of some infinite ones. This is because he can ask questions like """"if I choose an infinite integer at random, digit by digit, do I get a prime number?"""" Those sorts of questions have analytic counterparts about real numbers (complete numbers really). He probably feels the twin-prime conjecture is false, becuase, what's the chance that the infinite integer ....321113 and ....321115 are both prime? He also probably feels that an infinite even number can never be the sum of two primes. These last two statements are both based on my own thinking. He might thinks that there are very many primes at infinity, I don't know for sure. Look, I am not saying his mathematical musing are not cranckish. But recognize that Archimedes Plutonium is to cranck science as Isaac Newton is to mainstream science. He has seen futher than others even though he stands on the shoulders of no-one. """,0,0,0,0,0,0

""" Please leave messages that need to be read on Tony Sidaway's talk page This bot is approved and doesn't need a flag. Except for tests, it's inactive. The software it runs is called . It's open source (BSD license) and written in compiled Chicken Scheme. Purpose This is to be a general purpose query engine for English Wikipedia, using a simple functional programming interface to permit queries of varying complexity to be performed, and the results delivered to a nominated page in the user's userspace and, optionally, sent to the user's enabled email address. Query language The query language is based on scheme, a dialect of the lisp family. If you can write a simple lisp expression you can query this bot. Typical query functions will look like: (whatlinkshere PAGE) Produces a list of pages that link to the page. (editorsof PAGE [datetime-since [datetime-to]])) Produces a list of unique usernames and IP numbers identifying all editors of the page (editsof PAGE [datetime-since [datetime-to]]) Produces a list of edits to the page (editsby USERNAME/IP [datetime-since [datetime-to]]) Produces a list of edits by the user (apply EXPR [PAR...] LIST) Applies the single expression, with optional parameters, to the list (map EXPR [PAR...] [LIST...]) Maps the single expression, with optional parameters, to the each member of the list. (list [EXPR...]) Composes a list of the expressions (email EXPR) Sends the result of evaluating the expression in email. The result will also appear on the wiki. Using the bot To register to use the bot, you must edit the bulleted list of usernames at User:TonyBot/Users to add a link to a page in your userspace. If you simply add your userpage (User:Example), then TonyBot will use the page User:Example/TonyBot to communicate with you. If you add another page in your userspace, then it will use that page instead of User:Example/TonyBot. To make a query, edit your TonyBot page to add the query. TonyBot will execute the query and edit your TonyBot page to provide a link to a page containing the results. This will be at User:TonyBot/Example/N where N is a numeric value which has meaning only to the bot. Limitations Queries that take too long to execute may be stopped before completion Queries that are judged too complex will be rejected Queries that return very large volumes of data may be rejected or cut short. The value of """"too long"""", """"too complex"""" and """"very large"""" may vary over time in an unpredictable way. Conditions of use This bot is an experimental service and is provided as-is. Queries are run at the discretion of the bot operator and subject to the operational requirements of Wikipedia's services. It may be subject to unplanned outages, and may disappear without warning, at the discretion of the operator and subject to the wishes of the community. All queries must be made by registered Wikipedia users, in public, on the wiki. The bot owner reserves the right, for good reason and with the interests of Wikipedia in mind, to refuse access to any user. The reason for refusal will be stated publicly on the user's talk page and may be subject to revision if you can somehow successfully cajole, persuade or provide reasonable reassurances.

""" Still concerned about balance I've put in a fair bit of time on the article, both in verifying/cleaning content and filling in material, enough that I think I can say I have gone over things in detail. Look, for example, at Korea and the Caribbean/Cuba/Cuban missile crisis; those are a start on what I think is encyclopedic coverage. Just to say, with no other background, that the CIA trained police or set up an Operation Gladio network really doesn't give information; I'd recommend waiting for more background and context. There are news reports from reputable journalists, but there are also quite a number from activists for varying positions. I'm afraid I don't give equal credit to a staff writer for the Washington Post and for the Revolutionary Worker. The article is impossibly long, yet its covert operations section is full of fragments. It's going to have to break up so those fragmentary sections can be edited; it's taking a long time to save the file now. Note that I was able to put estimative/analytic material in for Korea and Cuba. Much data of that sort is available, often in the form of the actual declassified documents. Not to put in relevant reports, National Intelligence Estimates, etc., gives the impression that the agency is purely covert operations, since the reports were almost never mentioned for countries I sawjust controversial """"dirty tricks"""". That's not NPOV. Many sources are available for the report literature, including the George Washington University National Security Archives, the Avalon Project at Yale, the archives at Mount Holyoke, the military staff colleges and research institutes, the Foreign Relations of the United States series, and even the CIA FOIA Reading Room. There is, for example, a huge amount of reporting about Southeast Asia, including strong disagreements among the CIA, military, Office of the Secretary of Defense, and White House (Sam Adams' book, War of Numbers is excellent, but also see the Pentagon Papers). I'd like to suggest that people editing this look at some of my articles on the process of intelligence, which may help understand things that aren't just covert destabilization. Start with Intelligence cycle management, which will take you through a hierarchy of articles. The HUMINT sections do deal with clandestine rather than covert activity; I'm actively working on them. The article on Clandestine HUMINT and Covert Action is particularly relevant both in history, and balance between clandestine and covert activities. Especially in WWII, there was often a conflict between operations and intelligence gathering. Please let me help, but understand that my reaction is that things come across as very accusatory and unbalanced. Believe me, I am very aware of both improprieties and just plain incompetence in intelligence agencies, and they need to be brought out but in an encylopedic, not fragmentary and accusatory way.

"Why is an article about a Greek Orthodox theological subject being dominated by an Roman Catholic editor? Why is Esoglou making very disproportionate (at best) Roman Catholic additions to this article? Why is an article about a Greek philosophy and a Greek Orthodox concept (as it is used exclusively in the present) being dominated by the editor Esoglou? Why are there recent very long additions about people like Augustine whom in their writing never used the word (because Augustine could not speak nor read Greek). Being added to an article about the very essential difference between Roman Catholic and Orthodox theologies as specifically noted by scholars of Greek Orthodox theology? Why is Esoglou engaging in rewriting this article to say a concept that is almost exclusive spoken of in Greek? Why to an article about a theological concept so important to Greek Orthodox Theology that is mentioned by Greek Orthodox theologians in that way. Why is the actual text for the Roman Catholic church now equal to or more that the Eastern Orthodox? Even though the concept is not spoken of by the RC church per se? Why or what evidence is there to believe (outside of what anecdotal evidence Esoglou added) that theoria is now somehow something so Roman Catholic embraces in the way the Eastern Orthodox do? Why is Esoglou using this concept's article to ATTACK Greek theologians (John Romanides)? Why is it Esoglou could not make his edits to the article Contemplation instead? Since he uses the excuse that the term Contemplation is the same as theoria even though that is so vague as to miss the entire point of why Greek Orthodox theologians such as John S Romanides and Metropolitan Hierotheos Vlachos use the term theoria instead of contemplation. *Why is it that it appears that Esoglou's edits confuse the whole point of the article and I can not find any Roman Catholic sources let alone encyclopedia and scholarly sources that treat this subject the way Esoglou has rewritten the article? Why would it not seem that it is in Esoglou's best interest to discredit this theological subject because it contradicts his narrative that there is no fundamental difference between the Eastern Orthodox church and the Roman Catholic church. Why is it as the article is the specific difference it not to be believed that Esoglou is not POV pushing after he wrote this sentence in the article TODAY.. Contrary to what Romanides said, it is Roman Catholic teaching that God loves all, even those who choose against him, such as the devil. Why is in Esoglou's POV interest to either make the article incoherent, discredit the Orthodox theologians in the article or poison the well and have the article deleted wholesale? Why (if anyone spends the time to read what has been said on this article talkpage) it is not clear that Esoglou's behavior has tried all of these things and is actively now ruining the article and running contributors off of the article as his recent reverting and rewriting of the contributions made by User:Timothy.lucas.jaeger show. Why does the article not reflection how this concept is being used and presented by Greek theologians but is now peppered with Esoglou's anecdotal original research? His speculation, opinions and interpretations? Why is allowed to do this to various wikipedia articles without even once being banned for an hour let alone 24 hours? LoveMonkey",0,0,0,0,0,0

Seriously - I know you're better than this as I've seen you around quite a bit. You're obviously not yourself tonight. TAKE A BREAK. And this dispute has now been (erroneously, IMHO) posted on ANI. ( Spelling. That's so 20th Century, its called typos and it has nothing to do with spelling. All I want is for the NPOV tag to stay, its a reasonable request and its not asking too much as the article is POV. Best wishes. Cheers for the heads up re AN/I, Bah. Spelling is important when the medium being used is written. ) I don't understand why you are insisting on having a separate NPOV template instead of allowing the issue to be noted in the """"Multiple issues"""" template that is already in the article. Can you please explain? Oh I dont doubt the importance of spelling, its typing I find difficult. This article is so POV, I do intend to seek out some other refs but NPOV demands both sides are prevsented and as I made clear on the talk that isnt happening in this article. That some rascist editors are targetting it (eg the banned fourdee) is ample evidence of that. I am baffled as to why anyone would remove the NPOV tag, I never do that before resolving the issue, Please answer the question: Why do you insist on a separate NPOV template when the other one communicates the exact same idea but with less clutter? I removed the blue tag. I want the orange tag there and I have fully explained my reasons. The article presents one side of an argument and not the other. I dont understand what the controversy is as I removed the unnotable blue tag, No, I'm afraid that you haven't answered the question. I don't see a need to for multiple templates when one easily suffices. Nor do I. That is why I have removed the blue tag. An orange NPOV tag was created for a reason and it should stay as an orange tag. What is the problem? Anyway I see others are now edit warring, i wont touch the article till teoimorrow but gibvenm editors like fourdee have edited the article its POV status is inevitable, """,0,0,0,0,0,0

For example, a particular castle in Spain is now called, 'King Charles V's Castle'. The old and unused name of the castle is, 'Alcázar of Segovia'. Everyone in Spain calls this castle by, 'King Charles V's Castle', not 'Alcazar of Segovia'. The author refuses to accept this fact, though I provided solid sources supporting this historic truth. The author is biased against Spanish historical inferences for reasons I have yet to understand. He is not flexible.

"""== Old talk == Please, do not add Computer RPGs here - they are already listed in Computer Role Playing Games article. 07:46, 14 Nov 2003 (UTC) 26/7/2001 Should the games listing come out of the main page and instead go to somewhere like RPG/RPG Listings? Well, there are also listings in the subgenre articles, so I think we should merge them. 07:28 Jan 16, 2003 (UTC) I think the more useful distinction is between Role-playing games and Role-playing generally. I'm taking the latter from this page and making a new page just for the more general case. Also note that I use """"role-playing"""" as the generic term more commonly linked to psychological uses because it is so cited in Webster's New World College Dictionary. Moreover, I am adopting the """"role-playing game"""" usage (hyphen between role and playing) in order to follow that convention and because it makes sense grammatically (hyphenate compound adjectives modifying a noun). However I am thinking that """"role-play game"""" follows common usage better than """"role-playing game."""" But I'm not going to redirect the page now, anyway (Dec. 26, 2001) No one I know of (and I know lots of gamers) says """"role-play game"""". It's always """"role-playing game"""", and I am sure that's the most common usage. Not to sound like a nerd or anything, but White Wolf is not, strictly speaking, a role-playing game. They are a publisher. Their role-playing game universe, World of Darkness, encompasses between 5 and 12 or so (depending on how you count them) role-playing games... OK. I'm really not that much of a nerd... OK. Maybe just a bit. 10:39 Dec 6, 2002 (UTC) I added the """"Notable RPG Developers and Publishers"""" heading for links to companies (and maybe individual creators). 16:15 Dec 6, 2002 (UTC) Isn't Battletech more a table-top war game and not an RPG? I have never played it, but isn't there Mechwarrior, which is an RPG based on Battletech's world? 07:24 Jan 16, 2003 (UTC) Battletech was purely wargame, then Mechwarrior was made to turn it into an RPG, however they are basically the same thing, Mechwarrior is like AD&Ds; Player Handbook and BattleTech rules are simply the rules for combat, battletech being more complex than AD&D.; Battletech is notable from other RPGs in that correctly played one's character is as mortal as all the enemies one fights, so usually you die. Its basically a wargame where the units have stats which change over the course of a campaign, and most people generally have the commander of their forces represent themselves, thus, an RPG and a wargame. Also its common for the GM or DM to be replaced by a classical referee and then the players, instead of playing as a team, go to war with each other. Battletech was a miniatures game, based on Japanese anime, in the """"mech"""" genre. Later a set of rules was developed that allowed one to play a mech pilot in an ongoing campaign. Battletech was published FASA, which is now out of business. Along with Battletech FASA also published games such as """"Behind Enemy Lines"""" (World War Two skirmish game), """"Shadowrun"""" (cyberpunk/'magic returns' roleplaying), and """"Earthdawn"""" (fantasy roleplaying). At present both Battletech and Earthdawn have found new publishers. For a list of RPGs I recommend trying the Yahoo and Google directories You will find listings for literally hundreds of games. Have fun. Finally, when I have it composed I will be uploading an essay on roleplaying games, and why they really aren't games at all. At least not in the traditional sense of a game as something with victory conditions and competition among the participants.

But consider this. The censors became so smug that they inspired me to do some research a day or two ago (see my earlier note for date). It took me only minutes to learn that all whites are being targeted as part of a campaign of state-sanctioned racial expropriation and genocide. And so, the significance of the attack on Gordimer actually resides within a context that is staggeringly larger and more important than I had previously known. And yet, the censors are unmoved by this news. Imagine if the races were reversed. They would be shouting from the rooftops about the attack. But they do not want anyone to know about the South African genocide. Apparently, some cases of genocide are more equal than others.

"Jane Austen's Hi, I happen to have Tony1's talk page on my Watchlist left over from some ancient exchange, so I noticed your query about removing the full dates of birth and death of Jane Austen. Discouraging (without banning) month and day of birth or death is not consensus, although it is the strong opinion of many editors, disputed by many others, at at a straw poll currently being conducted at Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers). Since Jane Austen's editors have apparently decided against having an Information Box (which could display exact birthday and date of death), I think the argument for keeping them quickly accessible in this particular lead is rather stronger. And although I'm more of a Dickensian than an Austenite myself, I know several people in the San Francisco Bay Area who diligently celebrate Jane Austen's birthday with an annual ball. So in my book her birthday would fall in the same class as that of Abraham Lincoln (Kentucky, February 12, 1809 — Washington, D.C., April 15, 1865).",0,0,0,0,0,0

"The Bogdanov affair is the whole affair and not one article!!! You just try to found reasons to shut me up and abuse your status as admi to do so but ain't not better than YBM. You are doing exactly the same as him. Why do you remove my answer TO YOUR ARTICLE from the main frame and let the answer made by YBM and others for exemple? This is clearly discrimination. My answer is all too relevant to the affair discussed as are all my article as the last ones have to do with the crdibility of the people who have been the upmost against the Bogdanovs and have critisize their theory the most. I do not think that a DEA in informatic make a person capable to critisize the work of professionals in theorethic Physic. To do so you will have to be Stephen W Hawking and the alike. I have pointed how discusting the methods of YBM were and was able to come with tangibles prooves of it. Thats why he hurried to deleet them. But you came, afet 6 days he had done that and 6 days I tried to put it back, and...banished me!!! then after 9 days in all, you wrote your first intervention in this site and gave a warning to YBM, but.. you failled to punish him as well, and you commited the grave mistake to accuse me of having perpetrated the same kind of crime as he did, and by doing so, bagatelize the incident as being a commun little fight between 2 stupid users deleting each others column. But it isn't at all what happened. My answer to your intervention, more than being an internal dispute, had as goal to put things back where they belong, and regarded all users. They have to know that this YBM did deleeted my texts for a whole week, without any admin interventions, that you did bannished me but not him, and that you did bannished me again but not him, for personal reasons, and at the same time hinder the users to see the facts by removing them from where they belong and place them outside. You don not have answered any of my questions, and for you to know Cereal Killer is the admi of the french site about the bogdanov affair and is therefor very relevant to this case. As for your accusation of my pseudo crimes of having written in french, I wrote in french on heat after having read your answer, and translated it dtraight away in english, and the french version was no more than 10 to 15 minutes on line in the middle of the night, so do stop try to agress with lies, be more honnest with yourself, at least and say it as it is: you prefer the opinion of YBM, do not like the Bogdanov, thought you do not understand a thing about astrophysic, and you feel nothing but hatress and repulsion about me and what I stand for. i do not think that an aristrocats fan is welcome in a place like wiki who require essentially people having a great sens of honnor, democratie, equality, common sens, and who value ethic.

"Hazel Eyes Hi, I noticed you had reverted my changes to the hazel eye section however left me a message informing me I could contact you on your talk page providing more information. I've numerously tried to get Wikipedia to change the hazel eye color section as it's informing people that hazel eyes can be gold/brown and green (either could be dominant) which is a myth as a hazelnut doesn't contain any significant green colouration whatsoever, it is true that sometimes very minimal green tints are present in a brown eye to produce a golden glow and create the hazel colour but hazel eyes can never be eyes that are significantly green with slight brown/gold admixture, that is a North American misconception which is believed to have occurred in the past 100 years or so, as in Europe the origin of light/coloured eyes and hazelnuts, the true/original meaning is still used. The problem is there is no documentation on hazel eye definitions changing throughout the years nor has there ever been a study conducted tracing back to how the myth/misconception in North America came about, it's more of an assumption that people have come to realize as North Americans have started inaccurately identifying eyes that are significantly green with slight brown admixture as well as eyes that are blue or grey with brown admixture; as the colour hazel because they're multi-coloured and appear to change in different lighting even though they don't resemble the colour of a hazelnut in any way. It's an issue/myth that requires common sense to understand really, so even though I cannot provide you with documentation or studies concerning the changes of hazel eye definitions becoming misconceived in North America I can provide you with numerous sources/pictures of what hazel eyes are supposed to be and what the colour 'hazel' is described as being; http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hazel (defines it as a light golden brown colour, after a hazelnut) http://www.fanteye.com/extimages/p_FreshlooksColorblendsChartLG.jpg (shows a pure hazel eye, big difference to the green eye diagonally below to the right) http://ygraph.com/chart/2990 (shows hazel as a honey/beige brown colour and categorizes is next to another brown eye rather than green) http://www.colormecontacts.com/colored-contacts-for-dark-eyes (puts hazel eyes in the same category as honey, not green plus displays a green eye with abit of brown under the green category) http://www.yestheyrefake.net/color_contacts_buy_photos.htm (shows hazel eyes in numerous pictures presenting them as a golden brown) http://hazeleyes-wintergoddess.blogspot.com.au/2009/07/hazel-eyes.html (states the North American misconception and the true/original European definition while showing examples of various sources, numerous pictures and comments below of people agreeing and showing gratitude) http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_definition_of_Hazel_eyes (states the misconception and says that hazel eyes are supposed to match the hazel or cob nut, the fruit of the hazel bush/tree that grows in Europe) http://m.rateitall.com/iPhone/item.aspx?p=0&ItemID;=1074601 (shows an optometrists opinion/experience with the issue while stating the North American hazel eye misconception and providing sources backing up his statement) I would also like to state the very first reference to eyes ever being compared to the colour 'hazel' was by William Shakespeare in Romeo & Juliet in which he was comparing a persons eyes to the reddish brown colour of a ripe hazelnut; Mercutio: “Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes;–what eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?” Act 3. Scene I Romeo and Juliet Source: http://blog.wordnik.com/shakespeare-soup Considering William Shakespeare was an English writer it does prove the original intension/purpose of calling a persons eyes the colour hazel was to compare them to the colouration of either a light golden brown hazelnut or a reddish darker brown hazelnut and never a green and gold/brown mix or any multi-coloured eye (blue, grey or green with brown around the pupil) as a hazelnut doesn't present any blue, grey or green colouration nor is the colour 'hazel' described as possessing any of these colours. I only hope you're more understanding of this issue and can agree with what i'm saying, I strongly think you should keep my last changes to the hazel eye section so people can understand/know about what hazel eyes are supposed to be rather than leaving the information as it is feeding people with the North American myth. That being said the hazel eyes picture on the right of the hazel eye section isn't green or gold in any way it's actually a blue eye with significant brown around the pupil, the hazel eye section doesn't say anything about haz",0,0,0,0,0,0

""" * * * I look at a lot of articles (such as BillCJ and many others and it reminds me of books that were published in the 1950 - lots and lots of facts boring, dull uninteresting pictures - picture with no history surrounding what is being published. In the 1980-90's, a lot of True Aviation historians (i.e. Roger Freeman, Jeff Ethell, Warbirds Worldwide, etc..) found that aviation historians wanted and needed history recorded. The captions of their books detailed who, what, when, where, etc... As we progressed into the 2000's, I am finding that today’s writers unfortunately, want to dumb down the article - instead of giving all the details to allow the readers to decide how much level of detail he wants - Again, unfortunately, BillCJ (as well as others) want to take the Dick & Jane approach to aviation history. This is suppose to be an online reference/encyclopedia - often when you Google an item, the wiki article is the first reference to pop-up so this will be (unfortunately) the first and only reference many will have for a subject. A subject has to include everyone that references and item, whether it be a 4 year old doing his first model airplane, the aviation historian, the F-16 Buff. These articles are also used by serious models who want the details. Articles only tell part of the story - you need the pictures to compliment and point out what the article is discussing. In the same vein, the pictures need the same level of detailed study (if possible) and care that is place in creating the entire article. Having a great and fantastic article (such as the F-16) with kindergarten captions makes the entire article pointless. It is also unfortunate that other editors like Askari Mark feels that detailed captions are meaningless to most readers - again, you can not have an online reference/encyclopedia without filling crossing the t and doting the i's. Without detailed captions, it like having no reference section - sure you can print captions that state """" Gee an F-16 in Flight """" - especially when it is clear that the airplane is sitting on the ground. Or the case of one article """"Aircraft is on a bomb-run"""" when it was clear from the picture that the bomb-bay doors were closed, no guns in the waist position and the detailed history showed the aircraft actually was a trainer and never left the United State... BillCJ also mentioned """" are you seriously suggesting that """" serious historians """" only read WP articles for the pictures? """" - it is a proven fact that 90% of all information processed by humans come from Visual"""" data (i.e. pictures, etc...) - this is the reason Picture books are popular with preschoolers. The first thing a majority humans look out when reading any thing is the pictures - if the pictures are interesting then many people will stop and read. If an aviation historian comes across an article that details the subject matter then he will stop and read the contents. It is also been said that this article is not for the F-16 Buffs - if this is the case, then why have technical specifications why have details on each variation?? Why have the nuts and bolts of each individual user?? Etc, Etc, Etc... Why have detailed information regarding anything regarding the aircraft if this subject is not going to reach out to those who can say yes, this is true (i.e. the historian/buff) - If you are going to have the nuts and bolts in the article then you have to carry this same thought patterns over to have the nuts and bolts details in the photo captions.... (for example: B-52 Specifications, B-52 Costs, B-52 Variants) etc... this type of informations IS for the Aviation Historian / Buff and generally not for the casual reader (which is MY point in having detailed captions). If we dumbdown the photocaptions for the """"causual reader, then this level of details Specifications, costs, variations also needs to be removed as it will only confuse the """" casual reader """" and will lead to people calling all such information """" gobbledy-gook """". If we dumbdown the photocaptions or call detailed information """" gobbledy-gook to most readers """" then terms such as: Wing area, Airfoil, Zero-lift drag coefficient, Drag area, Aspect ratio, Maximum speed:, Combat radius:, Ferry range, Service ceiling ,Rate of climb, Wing loading, Thrust/weight, Lift-to-drag ratio are """"gobbledy-gook to most non-aviation readers"""" BillCJ has also mentioned that Wiki is not the place for F-16 Buff's to write article - This is complete opposite what the founders of wiki wanted when this project (wikipedia as a whole) dreamed many, many years ago - Wiki w",0,0,0,0,0,0

""" 2010 (UTC) I don't think the definition from Webbs really works given the change that has happened since it was first written (1917) . The idea that professionals """"supply disinterested counsel and service to others, for a direct and definite compensation, wholly apart from expectation of other business gain"""" is a bit naive, particularly in the I think a more realistic and up to date defintion is required. For instance, in the light of Holocaust, in which many German professionals acted as instruments of a disfunctional state, which would tend to indicate that """"service for others"""" may not be have the intention, but was taken to a tragic extreme. Likewise the recent financial crisis would tend to indicate that profession of banker (if it is a profession) has shown to conducted wholly for business gain (i.e. higher profit, larger bonuses), whilst other professions have shown themselves to be very interested in business gain, often to the detriment to the business (e.g. accountants in the Enron scandal).

"Help/Advice in creation of an article Hello Sir, I wanted to create a page on Mr. Ziauddin Yousafzai, father of Malala Yousafzai. But am unable to create a page on Ziauddin Yousafzai as now it is a redirect. Could you kindly remove the redirect so as to enable to create an article about him. Ok, the reason for the need of creation of an article on him is that now he has been appointed as United nation's Special advisor/envoy on Global Education http://www.livemint.com/Politics/7AmAud6bJ1of9J1fnfNfPN/Malalas-father-named-UN-advisor-on-education.html and also Pakistan’s education attache in Birmingham. http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/Europe/Diplomatic-role-for-Malala-s-dad/Article1-984617.aspx So IMHO, this makes him very much notable figure and as he has been nominated for the post of UN envoy, a page on him is feasible and needed.

Since the anniversary is tomorrow do you think there is some way that the article could be temporarily protected for a day to prevent last minute POV vandalism? List of functions Hi Jitse. I've replied to your question about List of mathematical functions on my talk page. ☎ 13:20, July 13, 2005 (UTC) Jitse Niesen has made a logical fallacy I would like to remind Jitse Niesen who claimed the facts below that he has made a logical falacy called """"Appeal To Widespread Belief"""" http://www.don-lindsay-archive.org/skeptic/arguments.html#bandwagon For example, in the 1800's there was a widespread belief that bloodletting cured sickness. Now we know it to be wrong. Thus, whether it be institutions such as NATO, the Red Sross, or individuals, their mere opinions about an issue cary little force when it comes to making a logical argument. In fact, the use of this falacy in an argument renders the arguemnt invalid; the author who uses Appeal To Widespread Belief is never taken seriously. Jitse Niesen wrote: """"I don't think dividing the sites in """"supporting genocide theses"""" and """"opposing genocide theses"""" is helpful. What you call the Bosnian/NATO point of view, is in fact also the point of view of the UN (including the ICTY), Japan, Indonesia, Red Cross, and pretty much the whole world."""" (preceding unsigned comment by 212.102.129.250 12:24, 14 July 2005) I agree that it is indeed a logical fallacy to conclude the truth of some statement from the fact that most (or even everybody) think it is true. However, I don't see where I have committed this mistake. In the second sentence of the fragment quoted to above, I say that the """"Bosnian/NATO point of view"""" is far more widespread than the Serbian one, which implies that it should get more attention since """"[i]f we are to represent the dispute fairly, we should present competing views in proportion to their representation among experts on the subject, or among the concerned parties"""" (quoting from WP:NPOV). What I do believe to be the case, though I am not saying above, is that widespread belief strongly suggests truth. The Truth Jitse Niesen wrote:""""Do you have specific suggestions on how we can improve the article?"""" Yes I do. I'll send you some articles on that topic when I have time, because I'm occupied preparing for some exams right now. Also you may take a look at www.ogrish.com, it you have membership credentials. I have some video materials too, showing the torture and death of Serbian civilians but have no way how to send you, but what I can do is to gather, or to write, something on Serbian history and culture that may change views because Serbs are often considered as """"occupators"""" of the Bosnia, but the fact is that they are natives there and the """"Bosniaks"""" are not a nation as they try to represent themselves today. They are merely Serb or Croats converted to Islam during the period of Ottoman Empire reign on the Balkan. Their language is Serbian.

""" Notability of Cecilia alexander A tag has been placed on Cecilia alexander requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article. If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

"Jung And Einstein In 1895 Albert Einstein was a pupil at cantonal school in Aarau, Switzerland. In 1896, after school in Switzerland, Einstein renounced his German citizenship. Carl P. Jung was born in in the Swiss canton (or county) of Thurgau. While Jung worked on Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido (Psychology of the Unconscious), tensions grew between Freud and Jung. Frank P. Geyer continued to serve as a detective until August 15, 1903 when he resigned. He had been transferred to the 18th Police District in the United States. Detective Geyer had arrested James Anderson; whether this is the same Anderson mentioned in Detective Geyer's 1896 work is non-determinable. In 1912 tensions between the two psychologists came to a peak. In 1901-02 Albert Einstein acquired Swiss citizenship and completed a scientific paper, obtaining a teaching position at school in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. The FBI file on Einstein came to light in 1983 when Robert Alan Schwartz wrote an article on the subject for The Nation magazine. Between J. Edgar Hoover and John Hutchison, democratic rights didn’t stop with McCarthy’s downfall nor with the demise of so-called notorious J. Edgar Hoover. Yet for years, zero-point energy according to Hutchison is obtained from the quantum vacuum. Hutchison claims on scientific phenomena are regularly featured and discussed by various media coverage. John Hutchison's claims of inventions and discoveries of a variety of phenomena are, like, NASA. The FBI should do an article on NASA and their non-determinable webers.

According to that policy he should have mentioned his intent to block me the admin notification board to let the other admins know prior top blocking me. He did not do that. He also is obligated to provide me with some specifics which he did not do. And """"Final warning"""" suggests a previous warning had been given. I would not be shocked if all my comments here get deleted and he uses WP:Soapbox as an excuse. Oh well, what are you gonna do. The only thing that bothers me is I cannot post anything on any of the admin boards to get a question or two answered and I cannot post on NCDave's talk page (he would appreciate the irony here I think). He also deleted my comments on the talk page yet he leaves dozens of actual viscous attacks done by others there, I attacked no one so this selective enforcement makes me smile too. I suspect the """"batman"""" comment sent him over the top (I'm Batman). But we have one guy claiming he's a nuclear scientists and therefore evolution is wrong, another guy (who this Night dude is demonstrably sympathetic too) who claims he's a doctor and has proven evolution to be false, so I figured letting the cat out of the bag and admitting I'm batman was just as relevant (shhh mum's the word, my wife would kill me if she knew I was a crime fighter). The talk page is obviously not a place for people to claim they can/have proven evolution to be wrong nor is it a good place to appeal to one's own authority. But, in Nightguy's eyes I guess you can claim you're a nuclear scientist but claiming to be batman somehow violates some policy.

"""Archive page 1 747 Table Hi how are you? On the table I created at Boeing 747, I intentionaly left the first 2 years before deliveries at zero to give a clear picture of when the fisrt plane was delivered to a customer. Had I started with 1969, it might make it seem like some deliveries might have been missed. But I started with 1967 and 1968 at zero to show a marked begining of 747s in service. If you dont mind I like to put it back to Zero. I'm good. Sure, change that back. That makes sense. It looked like maybe the deliveries started 2 years behind schedule. - Went ahead and changed the 1967 number back to 0. - 777-300ER thanks! People always make this range mistake. Another guy asked me why a 777F has more fuel than 777-200ER yet has 5,000 km less range? It took a while for him to get it. Sure. If you can improve the wording there more, please do so. - 787 How is it going? On Boeing 787 there are 8 different aircrafts in the specs. I believe we should remove all of them. Have a nice 3 table specification chart on the 787-3 787-8 787-9 and thats it. We can even bring the 3-way cross section of the 787 right next to this spec chart. I believe articles need to be stand alone and comparing it to everything diminishes this. Why not add Ilyushin il-96 here too then? Or many other aircaft. The 787 article is very very poorly done. Its not an encyclopedic entry. Its simply a collection of newsbits. It has become a forum to bash the A350 or even the A380. As soon as a story comes out, somebody writes a paragraph there. I have been doing some updates and I want to know if you agree about making the article more about the 787 and less about other planes. Hey, going OK here. I can see both sides on the comparison chart. 2 planes (one smaller and one larger) for comparson is enough. It'd be OK to remove non-787 planes since other airliner articles don't have them. The fact this is a new plane helps causes lower quality in the article, I think. People spend more time just adding info than cleaning it up and all. I'll keep an eye on it and do what I can. Take it easy Bangabalunga. - 747-8 Speed You are correct! It was .85 and .845 on Boeing last week. I dont know when they changed it. I know that wind tunnel testing has not gone well and the 747-8 will have more drag than 747-400 but I guess in order to have bragging rights against the A380, they must be faster. I am sure airlines will still cruise at 0.845 though in the Intercontinental just to be efficient. Take care No problem. The 747 has had a cruise speed of Mach 0.85 for some time. Don't think there's not that much a difference there. Good catch on the upper deck 3/10 windows thing. I was confused before. - Hughes Helicopters Some user slapped a {notability} tag on the Hughes Helicopters article. I removed it (to get his attention, as some people don't read the talk pages), and posted comments on the talk page also. I don't know what his problem with the page is, but it might be that it's unsourced. He just put the unreferenced tag up today, so it's not like noone won't know that's a problem. Can you take a look, and see what you think? Thanks. - Sure. Will do. - Inlet geometry On F/A-18 Hornet, you added the F-16 as having variable inlet geometry. I always understood that it was fixed on the F-16, and I can have several printed sources on that. Has that been changed on later F-16s? - I only reverted a change where the F-4 replaced the F-16 in this sentence: The engine air intake of the Hornet is notable among its contemporaries for being """"fixed"""", unlike the F-14, F-15, and F-16 which have variable geometry or variable ramp engine air intakes.. The F-4 is from an earlier era. Please correct that if needed. Thanks. - OK. I didn't check the earlier history. I just wanted to ask first to find out why it there in case you had a reason, and now I know. I'll take it out. THanks. - [[Use",0,0,0,0,0,0

"(UTC) I agree with User:Man with two legs that the graph is extremely misleading. See this quote about (or maybe from?) Edward Tufte: Before the development of spreadsheet graphing, the most common graphical mistake was the use of artist-drawn 3-D images with the height of 3-D objects representing the magnitude of the data points. In these charts, both the height and the width of the drawn object increase proportionate to the magnitude of the data points. The effect is to exaggerate the differences in magnitude as the viewer tends to perceive the area of the figures rather than just the height as representing the magnitude. (Source) The image suggests that the Tsar Bomba, which was three or four times more powerful than Castle Bravo, is actually 40 times larger in volume (or ~10x larger in area). If explosion volume went up by about the cube of the yield (not really accurate, but much closer than this chart) the Tsar Bomba mushroom cloud would be 1.5x taller than Castle Bravo and 15x taller than Hiroshima. Instead, the diagram shows the CB and TB over a thousand times taller. On this scale, one could conclude that since the Hiroshima bombing's mushroom cloud was about four miles high, the Tsar Bomba explosion (3,000x taller) must be larger than the Earth itself. 98.218.195.90 12:41, 6 July 2010",0,0,0,0,0,0

""" First, I'd like to thank you for discussing this issue with me. You could just have told me to take a hike or something. Anyway, let's take a look at Image:Esquire Jennifer Connelly 1991 8.jpg, the Jennifer Connelly picture that I tagged today. The image was moved to the infobox this morning which means that it was not being used according to the license. It was instead being used specifically to depict Connelly, not in context of discussing that particular issue of the magazine. That's why I tagged that image. With the image moved back to the paragraph concerning the issue of the magazine, a compelling argument could be made that the image is now being used in accord with the license. This seems to be the consensus of the people on the discussion page as well, though the discussion just started. So, whether or not this image is fair-use depends on how it is used in the article. I am much happier if this is spelled out in a rationale on the image page. That the license specifically states that a detailed fair-use rationale should be added seems, to me, to support this contention. In this case, the rationale would be simple, something along the lines of, """"used to depict issue of magazine in question in paragraph which discusses this issue, not solely to depict Connelly."""" Now, I previously mentioned that the image description page specifically mentions that the dvdcover requires a detailed rationale. In many cases, the fair-use case is obvious. It's a DVD cover used to illustrate the particular DVD in question. But the image description page and the license text both still indicate that the rationale is required. Also, what often ends up happening is that the DVD image then gets used to depict something outside of the license. A DVD of a movie starring Connelly, for example, used solely to illustrate what Connelly looks like. Now, I've been using the fair-use-disputed tag for quite some time but recently, people have been correcting that to the missing-rationale tag, so I just started using that. This has the added advantage of requiring that the issue be resolved in short order and providing a simple copy-and-paste official warning template which can be used (and is specifically designed) to warn the person who uploaded the image. I am concerned that a great number of images on Wikipedia are used in blatant violation of copyright. This is clear and I doubt anyone would debate it. As a result, I personally do request that people who upload copyrighted images provide an accurate source, an accurate license, and a detailed fair-use rationale. In all honesty, I'm quite happy with any reasonable attempt at a fair-use rationale and accept many that I believe fall far short of what Wikipedia officially requests. I believe it is important to deal with images without sufficient information because continuing to accept images which may violate copyright put us at direct risk. It may be obvious to the uploader why an image is fair-use but we may not be able to contact the uploader when we are sued. And as I mentioned before, I believe both the license and image description help page specifically require this. Now that I have stated my point and you have stated your point, there's a very good chance that we aren't going to agree. I'm happy to request additional help, perhaps from the admin noticeboard policies page, if you think this would be productive.

I am an Internet Network Engineer, Systems Administrator and Blogger, while I was working for Tara Systems I have done couples of Internet Installation using radios like Airaya and Ikarus, I set up the internet installation of Lagos Motor Boat Club(LMBC) Ikoyi using Airaya Radio(Between January to April) and also configured their wireless router, I also re-set up a point to multipoint netwok for Kakawa Discount House lagos Island (Between Nigeria to april 2008), I set up the Ikarus radio Internet Installation for NOVA Track(Coca Cola Branch Ebute Metta), I converted the Digital Subscrider Line(DSL) to Ikarus Radio for MUSON Center for Internet Connection(Between January and April), the following are other clients I have given Internet solutions to while working for Tara Syatems: Department of Petroleum resources(DPR)(re configuring and alignment of the radio to face the Network Operating Centre 2(NOC SEC 2), Fluid Management(re configuring and alignment of the radio to face the Network Operating Centre 2(NOC SEC 2), also did an Internet Installation for clients like Restral, Shofunde on St Nichlas Hospital building using a single Ikarus radio, but configured the routers so that three clienst on the same building can communicate to the one radio and eventually access Internet, This Technology saves wastage of material and requires skilled knowlwdge in IP Address, this was also employed, on Bull Plaza Building Lagos Island for three clients which Include Consolidated Discount.Goldman Asset e.t.c. while I was there I also worked as support Enginner and I had the privilege to be exposde to different Networking devices, like Cisco Routers,big Fast Iron e.t.c(Note however that I left this company in April 08, and the topology of the network might have been changed and re installed, Evidence on this facts can been gotten by requesting for the customers Service report from the companies as at the time the projects were executed.) Sometimes around April I thought I have had enough of Internet Networking and Installation , I wanted knowledge on Microsoft Networking(MICROSOFT SERVERS),Knowledge on SoftWares, Web Developping, So I headed to Icecool Contracts, where I work presently as Network Engineer, Systems Administrator. I proffer solutions to LAN Problems, Servers(Mail Server , Domain Server e.t.c) and other IT solutios in my jurisdiction.

There is a lot of talk in wikipedia about having a neutral POV but there is no such thing here. All the Castro's agents and lovers are here polishing his image probably getting paid with free vacations by the dictator at Varadero beach in Cuba while many true Cuban heroes die in prison just for opposing Castro and what he represents. A decadent regime, a waste of time for the Cuban people. Castro I know you or your agents will read this. So do not worry. History will take care of you and be assure that you will not look this good as it appear here. You could have been great a great leader if you had help Cuba get out of a dictator like Batista and then surrender power to the people to democracy! But you want to know something.

The same one you sell in t-shirts and postcards now and you profit from! That is because at least Che had principles, something you really do not know what it is or even fathom, he(Che) probably believe in communism and that it was a good thing because of his youth, while on the other hand you Castro just used it for your own personal benefit and profit. Ask yourself why Che die? why Camilo Cienfuegos die? and many others close to power in Cuba? Many people said that Castro himself send someone to kill him! He just can not stand someone close to power(because he is very afraid to loose it he is paranoid about it,obsess with power , anybody close to him have to be very careful no to upset him or to contradict any of his ideas even the bad ones.

Certainly they're very notable for the affair and of course Levy is very eminent. But what struck me about the original contribution was that it was sourced to the BBC in general ... 'the BBC notes' rather than to somebody at the BBC. No British writer would ever do that because of course the BBC aims, rather like Wikipedia, to provide balanced coverage and offers a representative range of views. It would be rather like an English writer citing a remark of Jean-François Kahn's but sourcing it instead generically to Marianne.

"How foolish of us not to think that. Man, be must be brain-dead not to realize this. Of course Charlie's pa stole the land. Everybody should ignore the fact that it is in the nature of an Empire to go and conquer everything they can. Of course it is wrong to steal back that land. Of corse the Empire has all the rights to take (i.e. not steal, just annex, colonize, brainwash, tax, aso) to land initially. They have the army to come and take any land they feel like. Of course if the Empire is weakened for 10-20 years because of a peasant revolution, it is wrong to steal back that land. Come on, who are Charlie's pa to steal back from that Empire? And who are they to even listen to what they have to say. An empire is an Empire and as long as they have a big enough big bloody army to it in the East of Charlie's land there is absolutly no point to argue agains.

Would you mind taking a look at the Szigeti article and giving me some feedback? I put it up for peer review a few days ago and all it got was a review generated by a bot. The only comment that I found useful was that I can sometimes be too wordy, there are apparently still redundancies and peacock termsbut I can't see any of that stuff in my own writing right now, I need someone with fresh eyes to look at it. I'm hoping to put it up on WP:FAC as soon as possible but I also don't want to nominate it before it's ready. Thanks, talk Looks good; it's thorough and reads well. As is my nature, rather than listing a lot of nit-picks, like they do at the Featured Article Pillory, Good Article Gauntlet and A-Class Inquisition, I uncapped my nit-picker and picked the few nits I found. Optionally you could expand the """"reception"""" section; there's lots of commentary on Szigeti's playing, and contrasts with his contemporaries oh, you know, everyone from Kreisler to Heifetz to Nathan Milstein might be interesting none of that is necessary, though, it's just something I might do if I were writing it. I wondered about separating out the """"family life"""" section from the main biography, since you cover the """"bureaucratic entanglements"""" part twice, but in different levels of detail, but if you stitch that into the main part of the biography it could overwhelm it, so ... maybe fine as is. Good article! (talk) Oh, one other minor thing I eradicated a lot of ghost hard returns, such as I hope I didn't inadvertently bork your paragraphing, since the paragraph is together in the visible text but appears to be split in the edit window. I assumed the lines were meant to be together. (talk) Thanks for the nitpicking, it was exactly what I wanted you to do. ) I've had the same thoughts about the """"Reception"""" section, just not really the time to go paw through the stacks to find interesting little tidbits. Any ideas on what books would be most useful in that regard? I meant to take out the now-redundant part about bureaucratic entanglements, must have just slipped my mind.

"Edit warring Please note that repeated attempts to remove sourced material from articles is likely to be considered to be edit warring, which may result in your being blocked from further editing of Wikipedia either temporarily or permanently. If you try to make a significant change to an article, and somebody else reverses it, the appropriate thing to do is to go to the talk page, have a reasoned discussion, and try to come to a joint view of what is the best way forward for the article (see WP:BRD). Merely trying to ram through the change you want to make by altering the article again and again is not acceptable, and will lead to sanctions being applied. For the moment, the article Haplogroup O-M176 (Y-DNA) has been locked for two weeks, so that no-one may edit it. If you sincerely believe that there are issues with some of the material being presented, please discuss your concerns on the talk page, and try to find an acceptable way forward. Note, however, that WP exists to make accessible material that has been published in what it considers to be reliable sources. If the material appears significant and relevant to the article, and has been published in a legitimate academic journal, normally one would expect to find it included in the article. Even if the material is questionable, if it is in wide circulation and often presented in discussions of the topic, then on those grounds alone it should still be included. If there are good grounds for questioning the material, those grounds can be discussed in the article but note that they must reflect the position of reliable sources that have been published and can be referenced, not just your own personal beliefs, knowledge, or unpublished research.

"No it is not reasonable to assume. In fact, virtually every mutant power has been completely missrepresented and changed in this movie series. Further, almost every facet of the characters lives have been changed in this movie series, so just because something happens in one continuity doesn't mean it will happen in another. Further, the section is about his appearance in the movie, not in the comic, so any details from the comic are completely irrelevant for his character. And using his comic book powers for reasons why the film makers would bring him back is an opinion. His body is completely charaed. Every character said he is dead. The creators of the film have not gone on reccord saying he is coming back or hinting at it or anything of this nature. The mentioning of his near deathes happened in the comicbook, not in the movie. This section is about his appearance in the movie, therefore, adding comic information in reference to his comic character is irrelevent. Further, CAPITALIZING your words does not porve anything and is completely silly. Find a source that says he didn't die from the movie, or the creators, or anything. Do not use comic books as an argument. Although the films have basis in the comics, the film makers only take what they want and have shown considerable creative license throughout this film to change stories as they see fit (sebastian shaws origins and powers, weakening of magneto by only showing his magnetic abilities, making havok not be cyclopse's younger brother, changing mistiques origins, changing azazel's origins, etc). Therefore, you can only talk about Darwin's appearance in the movie, as he appears in the movie. His body is completely destroyed, every character said he is dead. The creators have said nothing about him being alive. Find a source that says his powers follow like the books and he is alive, then you have an argument. Unless you have some other argument beyond the comics, do not wast time arguing .",0,0,0,0,0,0

Drmies claims below that I had received a """"final warning"""" before being blocked, but no such final warning not even any initial warning was received.

""" External links on ballet Hello! External links are often taken as a """"For further reading"""" section, and as such, should complement the article, adding information we could not. As for ballet terminology, Wikipedia has a Glossary of ballet, and as we are working to create free content, it is more beneficial for us to create a better repository of terms and their meanings than to link to a copyrighted collection. Similarly, we shouldn't be linking to content which we should have, or which is only marginally related (physics of all dance is only marginally related to ballet). However, if you meant to reference a section, there's a different method of going about this documented at Wikipedia:Citing sources. The links used would be contained in a ==References== section, and it'd especially help if you could indicate which facts were verified and which weren't. The Ballet article is currently undergoing a rewrite, and any help you could offer would be appreciated (see the talk page and WikiProject Ballet's article improvement page for more information on what needs doing).

""" I'm not seeing what points readers to Hotchkiss in popular culture. Please clarify. If the section is called """"Hotchkiss in Print"""" then maybe movie references are not appropriate here, or the section should be renamed. As to your point about """"disgruntled alums:"""" Whether the quotations are positive or negative is immaterial. If they are references in print and they shed light on the history and reputation of the school, then the quotations seem entirely appropriate here. Would we want to include every last mention of Hotchkiss in the written record? Perhaps not. However, below are reasons for including quotes I have recently added (actually, re-added because they were removed at some point). Thomas Hoving quotation: Hoving is one of the more notable alums, a longtime director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. As a public figure who is also an alum, his perspective on the school is significant. McPhee is also a leading writer of profiles and this piece originally appeared in the New Yorker. So, it's authoritative. The Cullman quotation: I believe Cullman was chairman of the board of trustees, and the Cullman family has been one of the school's major supporters. Since Cullman is an alumnus and a prominent supporter, his comments on the school are worth noting. Julian Houston is a judge in Massachusetts. As a successful legal professional, an alumnus, and a person of color, who has written a book that is clearly based on his experience at the school, it is appropriate to quote him on his time at the school. Archibald MacLeish is among the school's most prominent alumni. Because of his stature, his comments on the school are notable. Lemisch is both an alumnus and an emeritus history professor, who has written an article on the history of Hotchkiss. Because he is an alum and a historian, and because the subject of this article is the history of the school, a quotation from it is notable. The above reasons support the relevance of these quotations to this article. If there are other quotes by prominent alums who enjoyed their time at Hotchkiss, of course those would be worth citing here as well. """,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This article is currently not balanced. It provides only a cursory summary of the official report, and then an excessively long section on the disputed account. This gives the (incorrect) impression that the official account is inadequate or wrong. Ultimately, there is one fact that is not disputed - Captain Asseline flew the aircraft into a stall. This is a very bad thing for a pilot to do at any time, and a cardinal sin when done 30 ft above the ground. The evidence is clear – the plane was at alphamax (high angle of attack), at very low airspeed, and with engine set to idle. Asseline has nobody else to blame for putting the plane into such a dangerous configuration, he was in command. All the other distracting issues, eg. precise altitude, wearing a headset, engine lag in responding to throttle-up command, etc etc, are little more than red herrings because none of them excuse the fact that the plane stalled due to pilot error. There is a lot of evidence in the official report (I haven’t been able to find a version translated into English), it’s pretty clear what actually happened. Oh, and reference 3 is a bit dubious; full of wacky conspiracy theories with no evidence to back them up. I propose that the article needs a major overhaul, trimming a lot out of the disputed account and providing more information from the official report.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"This is now very concerning. I emailed Elonka last night about my scepticism as to the real identity of these posts. My suspicions arose when I received an email from (a) Lord Knowle to help edit the Knights Templar article. Looking back on it later it did seem diferent from the usual style that I would normally get from the person that I know who owns this account.

""" I know allegations of admin abuse require clear proof, but it may be below. See, I wouldn't mind so much if I knew what bad behavior I was doing. I have in good faith begged and pleaded for anyone, anyone with expertise or experience to explain what was blockable; please take the time to review considerately. At virtually every turn, when I requested a policy clarification as a 2-month user, if I even got a cite, it was only to a whole policy page, and never with a diff to my alleged offense. This behavior is so consistent from so many users that it is hard to explain, much less to provide sources for this possibly exceptional claim. But let's please start with what points I do get, and the questions I need answered first by you, the reviewer: (N.b. I wrote this the first hour of block. I trustingly clicked Save and did not realize that there would be an edit conflict due to the edit warrior (below) closely following me and stating her block agreement """"sadly"""" (huh?) and giving nuanced advice and compliments (unhelpful). This minor frustration can be gotten past, but of course this request is now many hours late. PLEASE at least quickly indicate willingness to answer.) See whole discussion. As near as I can tell, WP:POINT is intended to refer to my politely proposing a change to WP:V (my first policy suggestion) and disclosing what I regarded as an edit war about the issue. Instead of any comments on the merits (except one positive one), I received consistent criticism about my poor formatting followed by refusal to address the merits because (apparently) it was obviously unnecessary to answer. Q. When one has made a policy suggestion in good faith and one receives zero discussion on its negatives and significant negative discussion on one's person and presentation, is one refusing to get the point if one continues politely requesting the specific demerits of the proposal that would indicate nonconsensus on its merits? See whole user discussion. As near as I can tell, WP:HAR (first I've heard of this charge against me) is intended to refer to my appropriate-level user warnings in response to an editor using obscenity and assuming bad faith this is only the most reasonable guess, of course. After he stated he was entitled to assume bad faith, he changed up and claimed facetiously he really was assuming good faith. My links there indicate specifically what behavior I referred to. I know of no other case which might come near to harassment. Q. When one uses edit warnings in full compliance with policy and is met with continuing bad faith, is one harassing? See whole COI discussion. As near as I can tell, WP:DE is intended to refer primarily to my first extended correction of a user charging me with COI, along with a suggestion that the accusing user may also have COI. Certainly I might have been overstrong in that edit (I recognize not noticing the 200-word limit, but I adverted that myself). But again, there was no indication of why a donor to a political candidate has the sort of close relationship envisioned by COI. There was one attempt at googling me (and I'm not looking up the personal details policy right now) which turned up nothing undisclosed besides my blog comments but this was described as """"considerable involvement of ... promotional activities"""". Recall there are about 60,000 Ron Paul Meetup volunteers, and nearly that many donors. If I worked for a 60,000-member workplace there might be a bit more point, but even that would be debatable in good faith. Q. Is every political donor or Meetup member forbidden from editing candidate-related articles neutrally, or only those who willingly disclose the relationship? As near as I can tell, there is a further potential application of WP:POINT (which by the way is an application of the rule, convenient to the generic, that a generic warning is fungible with any warning). Apparently I don't realize that, in some sense, these users are every one justified in refusing to explain specifically any of their adverse actions against me, and that I am being disruptively pointed if I explain specific charges against them, citing policy and diffs. And there I do admit not understanding. The policies are no Procrustean bed, but very specific. I am completely unfamiliar with operating in such an environment other than to do one's best to WP:AGF, to complain properly and carefully, and to accept potential suffering for it. However I'm essentially barred by generic threats (yes) from complaining specifically, and I'm completely certain that a generic, unsourced complaint from me (as appears to be the",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Topic ban violation and sock puppetry Hello. You had some interaction with IP in connection with the Golan Heights so accordingly, I am notifying you and Stifle of a matter that is of serious concern. I have reason to believe that this IP user is Nableezy trying to circumvent a topic ban imposed on him by Stifle. The ban forbids him from editing or commenting on the Golan Heights and all areas of Israel and its environs including cities, settlements and regions. The IP in question geolocates to Chicago and the edit in question is consistent with Nableezy’s POV. Prior to the instant edits, the IP never made any edits to the topic area and the first edit that he makes in the topic area is to The Golan Heights. Nableezy is also from Chicago as evidenced from his early Trait Page But there is more. The subject IP also made edits to a hockey article involving players in the NHL. Nableezy has expressed more than a passing interest for this subject as evidenced by this But the similarities between the IP user and nableezy do not end there. The subject IP made this edit on a very technical subject involving circuitry and electronics.

In English, that's some. Now that's to be distinguished from 'several' which is a usual indicator of more than, say, two or three. So to use the word 'several,' in an argument, is to imply, at least more than two. So when an acquaintance of ours, name of , known to Block and recently given some Wiki admin. priviliges (AP) cites in his AP pleading: He has been in dispute with several editors ... he's padding his case, since Blacketer full well knows that the only folks giving grief were: Block Blacketer This came about because I started adding much more material to the Wiki entry on Natascha Engel and, in my innocence, I sidled-up to the Village Pump to seek advice on the substantiation of some of my contributions. I was particularly perplexed by the problem of my knowing certain facts through my personal correspondence with her. Extensive source is available on the Talk page for the Engel article about what transpired next. Well, anyway, Galloglass left the scene pretty quickly, so that left me contending with Block and Blacketer. Now correct me if I'm being stupid, but to me that leaves two. Then, mid-ocean Block jumps ship claiming a syndrome he named 'wikibonked' (I think - I've no idea what it means, but I think I'm getting to the stage where I may have caught a dose;-) So that left one ... Blacketer. So 'one' is Blacketer's version of 'several.' And then you made him an administrator. I've brought Blacketer to the stage since he's part of the same story of the 'double-standards' and 'hypocrisy' that I've discovered around here.

""" are you a troll? You call me a troll.

With a shrine inscripted with more than 3,000 fallen roman soldiers, only the limited wall surface of the shrine limiting the names inscriptions.., this also being called by you """"a decissive roman victory""""😉 for Sarmizegetusa, not conqered at that time by the romans, which started towards it but were stopped at Tapae, and when the Dacians stopped fighting because of the legendary """"strange storm"""", """"anger of the Dacian Gods"""", and they were defenceless, the romans, also a few miles only from Sarmizgetusa and open for taking, ran as crazy 700km in 4 days, to their reserve troops at Adamclisi.. and you call this """"decisive roman victory""""😉), and 15,000 Dacian soldiers in the second big war, of AD 105, ending in 106AD. This correct troops amount stayed a few decades (anyway many years; I made screenshots at some point for a school documentary), and only recently somebody vandalised the site changing the amount in a couple of hundred thousands, with NO SOURCE REFERENCES what so ever, and he couldn't do it too as all historical info points out the tiny Dacian army at that time. YOU, as administrator, in sted of correcting the vandalism and restore the page, didn't give a damn.. When I came and restored the info, doing YOUR JOB, you acuse me of """"vandalism""""😉, and that """"I am partial to the Dacians"""", while you are the one partial to the romans and to vandalism. Further more, you acuse me that """"being partial to the Dacians""""😉, I said that the Dacians won, not the romans, adding that """"I did not attach sources ref./proof""""😉. On the page of the First Battle of Tapae, was allways mentioned (with source ref. attached; poorly and only 1 source while there are many.. but OK) that the governer (of the invading roman army in the DACIAN Moesia) was killed together with his army (that is correct). This first battle of Tapae (again BS; it was the battle of the romams for Sarmizegetusa, also stopped at Tapae, Sarmizwgetusa was NOT conquered, that's why was called The battle of """"Tapae"""" which was nothing, just an emlty field, and the roman empire does NOT fight to conquer grass and empty fields) was also lost by the roman army which was totally defeated/anhilated, and even Fuscus died in battle. All these info are correct and o your/that page. Accepted by you as administrator. You call this """"a roman victory""""😉. If i call it as it is, a Dacian victory, you call me a troll and tell me that """"that didn't happened"""", meaning Dacian victory. Than WHAT do you call it? It's a retorical question. I am a pretty known international history investigator, and my coleagues often make fun of the wikipedia trolls which poses as administrators. I mean.. the facts speak for themselfs. You change Dacian victories in """"indecisive battle"""", and indecisive battles in """"roman victory"""", which makes you automaticaly bias, and history falsifier, obviously in favour of the invading hoodlam romans. You go so far in presenting the invading (into Dacian teritories) romans as """"the good guys"""" and the Dacians as """"bad guys"""", that you even post totally ridiculous texts like """"the Dacians invaded Dacia, and the romans (coming beligerantly all the way from Italy) were right to punishe the Dacians for that""""😉. How criminal are you? About you history knowlwdge (if any) is pointless to ask. Right? All the so called (also BS because the Dacians never started nor wanted war) """"Dacian Wars"""", which were actually Roman wars, started by the invading roman army, and all took place OUTSIDE Italy, into Dacian/Thracian teritories. Roman wars, and you call them """"Dacian wars"""", to manipulate the readers on subliminal levels. Moesia, which was also Dacian teritory (by the way, you can find this info also on wikipedia if you have no official sources), invaded, masacred and robbed by the roman army coming from Italy, when saved from the romans by the Dacians (as it was part of Dacia), is called by you on your page """"murdering dacians""""😉, """"the dacians swarmed into Moesia to rob and pilleage""""😉.. and other bullshit. So the dacians were the robbers or the romans?? And WHAT did the Dacians had to rob from their own dacian teritory??

But in many instances, the citation is doubled up and the claim/information is cross referenced between those two sources. But if some is unacceptable then we will have to make adjustments. Maybe it can be rescued if we point out that it's his claims and we say that he *claimed* to develop a car with only 32 moving parts. We have no source for this except two interviews with him, one which he also seems to claim to have invented 3D TV, that articles' reliability is maybe not as high as we want it to be. But I suspect that in biographies we shouldn't have personal claims even if we mar them as such, but somebody with more BLP experience than me should make that call. There are some parts of the article regarding the theory of The Venus Project that I disagree with, but on the whole it seems to be an outstanding piece of work. There is a lot of stuff about Jacque Fresco that I would have never known about if this article had never been written. Very nice, short, interesting biography; well done. I like it. ( ) For the most part, I copied that info from the Venus Project article. I plan on expanding the Venus Project article to cover more of the theory, and will then modify the info for it on the Fresco page. """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Please do be careful in reviewing potential FACs, however; despite the obvious need for reviewers at GAC/PR/FAC, I know that I personally would rather have one very good, knowledgeable reviewer than several who may not be as good and/or knowledgeable. That is where my frustration stemmed from, and now I know where yours did as well. Thanks, (habla conmigo) Sigh - my page seems to be causing too much drama these days so I'll bring this here. First, re the grammar, I'll address that on the talk page. If it would help I'm more than happy to send Sage and Awadewit email giving them permission to divulge to you their impression of whether I am qualified a; to make judgement regarding literature; and b; to have a sense of what or what not academics here need or want. Would that be helpful at all? The Red Badge of Courage is of high importance in the canon of Am lit and needs to be done right. I was quite careful in the GA review before passing it. There is perhaps room for development regarding themes, but what's there is presented succinctly and is easy to read. Quite honestly I'm tempted to take the monstrosity I've created with The Sun Also Rises and simplify following the example of Red Badge. Anyway, thanks for the pie - I even have a chair on my page, so I can sit and eat pie and fight with the AN/I crowd ) Hey, no fair! Truthkeeper got a pie and I only got a lousy cupcake? ) Seriously, though (and this goes to both Sadads and Truthkeeper), thank you both for your input on Red Badge. The problem with such important and, quite frankly, brilliant novels like Red Badge and The Sun Also Rises is trying to strike that perfect balance between readability and encyclopedic value. It's so difficult to get just right, and as a result no two novel-related articles are ever the same. Perhaps that's why a project like WP:NOVELS will never be sustainable in quite the same way as WikiProjects dedicated to battleships, films, or even fungi. A few years ago when I tried to resurrect the project, it was unfortunately a waste of time for me, personally; while my interests even then were leaning toward classic literature, it seemed that many members were only occupied with popular literature. We could never seem to organize ourselves, and it seems that continues today. That, and I admittedly seem to work better by myself. I apologize for my shortness with you; I know you meant well, but my high standards clouded that fact. I'm sorry if this episode may have hastened a wiki-break on your part. I hope it doesn't keep you away from long, since it's obvious you have your fingers in many Wiki-pies, and you obviously enjoy what you do! Y",0,0,0,0,0,0

""" Temple of Diana Quote from """"Pre-Norman cathedral"""" section: """"Geoffrey of Monmouth claimed that the cathedral had been built on the site of a temple dedicated to the goddess Diana, in alignment with the Apollo temple that he imagined once stood at Westminster..."""". Nonsense - Geoffrey did NOT make such a claim. The idea that (following the persecution of Christians by Diocletian) Apollo was worshipped at Westminster and Diana in London comes from the history of Westminster Abbey by John Flete, 15th-century monk of Westminster - and he didn't say that Diana was worshipped on the site of St Paul's. That comes from William Camden's Britannia, published in 1586. Camden puts forward the theory that a Roman Temple of Diana had once stood on the site of St Paul's. His evidence is not accepted by modern archaeologists. And if the """"in alignment with"""" phrase actually means what it says, one can only respond that a straight line can indeed be drawn between any two points! Since the sentence about Geoffrey of Monmouth is unreferenced and unverifiable (as well as untrue) I'm simply going to delete it pro tem - unless someone can provide the essential reference to a verifiable source. However, since the """"Temple of Diana"""" story still resurfaces occasionally (along with the """"megalithic stone circle""""!) it will be worth reintroducing it at some point, correctly attributed and with proper references. - """,0,0,0,0,0,0

""" Agreed. We really should try to stick to the subject of the article at hand. And looking through the Jeremy Clarkson article I see there really isn't a lot about his penchant for speed. It's mentioned, but just briefly, alongside his clean driving record. However in searching via Google, I found this article, http://driving.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,12529-1890873_2,00.html This to me seems rather striking, to have somebody talking so openly about speed. Maybe we could change the article around to be, In spite of his penchant for speed, Clarkson holds a clean driving licence. None the less, he is not especially reluctant to discuss the subject of speed. In a November 2005 article in """"The Sunday Times"""", Mr. Clarkson wrote, while discussing the Bugatti Veyron, """"On a recent drive across Europe I desperately wanted to reach the top speed but I ran out of road when the needle hit 240mph"""", and later, in the same article, """"From behind the wheel of a Veyron, France is the size of a small coconut. I cannot tell you how fast I crossed it the other day. Because you simply wouldn’t believe me"""". Could we write that ? These two quotes are rather remarkable, in my opinion, and worth mentioning in the article. They demonstrate his honest and frank manner of discussing his travels across Europe. And we could just leave it to the reader to decide if he is talking about going 240mph on public roads, or whatever. I realize you may feel differently about Mr. Clarkson than I do, but none the less, these two quotes do clarify his penchant for speed, and are worth mentioning, alongside his clean driving record, I would say.

"Sources people,no propaganda The following comments have been deleted: The band promotes Croatian patriotism and ultra-nationalism, and sings about topics such as the love for one's country, family and religion, but also about the hatred of Serbs and Croatian social democrats. Dealing with such topics has made the band controversial. Perković has been known to openly promote Ustaša ideology because he wears black clothes, salutes in the corresponding way and had often openly supported the Ustaše and the NDH in his statements to the media. Ultra-nationalism?Ultra-nationalism means that you want to destroy everything that is not of your nation.While patriotism means that you love your own nation,but you respect others.Where in his songs does he promote hate to other nations?And no mentioning songs created in time of war against the Serbs,because it was the time of war.And only mention songs written by him.Not what he is accused of performing. Hatred toward SDP?Where?Name source.He is right wing,that si widely known.Of course he disagrees with their politics and he considers their politics bad for Croatia,but hatred? Reliable source please. Where does he promote openly Ustashe?Citation please.Because he wears black clothes?Are all rockers Ustashe?By this,rock 'n' roll is equal fascism.He is a rock singer,of course he wears black clothes. Salute he uses is an old salute of Croatian nobles,that existed long before Ustashe. Despite this, his statements confirming his support for the Ustaše actually outnumber his denouncements of this virtual NSDAP equivalent (he is noted to have publicly voiced his support for the NDH, in various degrees, to the media on at least twenty occasions). His credibility in these statements is diminished not only by this fact but also by the legal necessity to denounce any fascist movement in order to avoid further banning (or other legal action). Again,I see that this is already discussed.Feral is not reliable,its a tabloid.Only reliable newspapers should be used.And these quotations in Feral,while they may be true,there are no links to check the meaning,because they may be taken out of contest,and they could have totally fifferent meaning ii their original contest.This is not reliable.

"I read an interesting essay once, entitled: The Pre-Med as a Metaphor of Antipathy. The author was (IIRC) a basic-science professor trying to understand why pre-meds were such jerks, and whether the qualities selected for by the pre-med process were necessarily the ones that would make for an exemplary physician. Taking the pre-med curriculum was among the most depressing experiences of my life - a relentlessly grinding, competitive exercise in rote memorization of material that held little interest or applicability for me. I felt bad for people who took organic chemistry and biology because they were actually interested in those subjects - they were trampled in a horde of people who had come from the top of their high school classes and were trying to beat the curve, inexorably normed to a C+/B-, to get into med school.I certainly witnessed a reasonable amount of cheating, and I'm sure there were more egregious things happening out of plain sight. I was amazed, when I took the MCATs, at the level of security and anti-cheating measures in place. They did basically everything except a retinal scan, but I suppose such things are necessary.

""" Well, all of that stuff came straight from either the NY appellate courts opinion or the US Supreme Court's opinion in that related case. i will also try to find more sources. This case is a landmark case because it established, for the first time ever, the civil tort of false light claims and what the elements of those claims are. It was relied upon by SCOTUS as well as courts in all 50 states. To be honest, this is probably the only thing this guy is known for (unless you lived way back in the 40's while he played). That is why it is so important. False light remains the least-recognized and most controversial aspect of invasion of privacy. See BRUCE W. SANFORD, LIBEL AND PRIVACY § 11.4.1 at 567 (2d ed. 1991) (""""Of Dean Prosser's four types of privacy torts, the 'false light' school has generated the most criticism because of its elusive, amorphous nature.""""); Diane Leenheer Zimmerman, False Light Invasion of Privacy: The Light that Failed , 64 N.Y.U.L.

Ct. 534, the United States Supreme Court has held that the tort of false light is consistent with First Amendment freedoms provided there is a finding of actual malice, knowledge of the falsity, or of reckless disregard of the truth. See also Cantrell v. Forest City Publishing Co., 419 U.S. 245, 251-53, 42 L. Ed. 2d 419, 95 S. Ct. 465. But I will find some other sources and add them later this evening. Hope that works.

""" THIS IS MY REPLY TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE DELETED ACTING AS A FASCIST FROM THE DISCUSSION ON NICOSIA PAGE: Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the cityDear Salvio, You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period. May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2 and Chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds. There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of """"shame"""" and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of Cyprus by the Turkish army. The Greek flag is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC. It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character. This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour. In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self.

The nominator seems to reason that the page be deleted purely because he or she doesn't know anything about the subject and can't find/hasn't looked for any sources. There is no question that the subject passes WP:ATHLETE since the single source describes him as one of a professional club's most important players. A cursory search of google throws up plenty of mentions on forums etc. of his exploits in the Malaysian league. Although these are not reliable sources, it makes a nonsense of the speculative idea that he was registered to a series of leading clubs but never took to the field.

""" The user's final edit was to blank his Talk page with the edit summary """"fuck it."""" The page blanking was reverted """"because of an active block"""". The block is no longer active, the user has not returned to Wikipedia, and I think it is pretty clear that """"fuck it"""" is the equivalent of """"I am retiring from Wikipedia."""" It seems to me that if someone has expressed quite clearly that they don't want to come back to Wikipedia and that they don't want their sad saga displayed on their Talk page for all eternity, that is within their rights. Also, I question whether the initial reversion of the page blanking was even according to policy. Show me one policy that says you cannot blank active block messages on your talk page, hmmm? While WP:DRC is merely a guideline, there is a distinct lack of Wikipedia policy limiting what kind of content users can remove from their Talk page. I happen to think there should be policy limiting what a person is allowed to remove from their own talk page (e.g. warnings <24 hours old and active block notices) but as it currently stands there is no such policy, at least not that I can find. (If I am wrong, please enlighten me!) If I have to abide by rules I think are dumb, then so does everybody else. In fact, that is the difference between us and Karaku Karaku disagreed with the rules so he chose to aggressively break them and call everyone else ignorant. I disagree with the rules, but I realize they have been formed by community consensus and so I will abide by them as long as they are in place. And by my interpretation of the current rules, Karaku's blanking of the Talk page should never have been reverted. Furthermore, while I recognize that I was using the word """"VANISH"""" imprecisely, it appears to be a longstanding tradition in Wikipedia that if a user wants to just leave and clear out the ugly history of their wrongdoing, they have the right to do that. Karaku very clearly indicated a desire to do just that (is there really that much difference between putting a banner saying """"Retired"""" at the top of your Talk page vs. blanking the thing with the edit summary """"fuck it""""?). Anyway, I'm obviously not going to get in an edit war over a retired user's talk page.

"""==Notability of Jeff tragedy== A tag has been placed on Jeff tragedy, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines. For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies.

Yet you have your links listed as if they are completely true. Like most critics of Freemasonry, you have a bad habit of taking things out of context. However, if a Mason tells you you're wrong, it's """"Masonic bias"""", and apparently because we don't want you to reveal some deep, dark secret. I know perfectrly well that people love conspiracy theories, so there's that to consider, but my main concern is that it appears to be that you are attempting to wage some sort of personal crusade. Otherwise you wouldn't feel the need to publicize said material on your userpage. The sources you have were discussed at length, and were shown to be inaccurate by objective evidence rather than personal opinion. There is a difference. Now, let's look at it this way: not being a Roman Catholic, if I were to turn around and say that """"Roman Catholics are pagans"""" because I could find instances where it was stated or claimed that Roman Catholics worship idols (largely by picking and choosing my quotes out of context as I saw fit), and tried to put it in an article, do you think it would be """"fear"""" on your part that would make you remove that information, or rather the simple fact that as a Roman Catholic, you know better and are aware that the statement is false? Or would that be """"Roman Catholic bias""""? As for accuracy of sources, so-called """"Masonic sources"""" as fed through Ephesians, FMW, and other sites are inaccurate from a fundamental verifiability standpoint.

"""==Removal of seal== The University seal was removed from this page. Per the University's official logo guidelines, available at http://logo.wustl.edu, the seal is limited to items for Commencement and those events sponsored by the Board of Trustees, the Chancellor, or the deans and requires special permission from the University for use. Please be advised that the University has in the past pursued legal action when images and symbols are used without permission for which permission is specifically required. This unsigned comment was added by (talk • contribs) . First, I must kindly ask the user who posted this topic to please sign their username to their post in future. Secondly, the use of Washington University’s seal in a Wikipedia article is perfectly fair and legal. Just as wikipedia is allowed to use the logo’s of McDonalds , Apple, and other US corporations that have also copyrighted their logo’s, a wikipedia article is still allowed to use College and University seals under the US copyright law’s fair use'' policy. Wikipedia does not need permission to use Washington University’s seal so long as it meets the fair use qualifications. Every other university's seal including Harvard's, Northwestern's, and Yale's is used in Wikipedia articles that reference them, even though they have similar policies about university seal use. This because wikipedia is a non-profit foundation, allowed to use copyrighted logo’s under the fair use policy. I will be reinstating Washington University's Seal to meet the format consistent with other US College and university articles. Please be advised that legal counsel has been notified. The University makes available the official University logo for these purposes. Use of the University seal is strictly prohibited and protected. The use of the Washington University seal even if it is copyrighted is allowed on Wikipedia through the fair use policy. Notify legal consul if you must but the Fair use policy has already been affirmed in court see: Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corporation. I have also examined user 's discussion page and found that the user has flouted Wikipedia rules and regulations in the past. Taking this into account I will continue to reinstate the university seal until the user presents a concrete reason why I should not. Placing the university seal on the wikipedia article that it concerns is consistent with wikipedia format, and encouraged by the wikipedia community. The same policy which governs the use of Washington University logo also governs the Washington University seal. And I question to be a spokesperson for the university and decide that it is acceptable to use the logo. Although I was unable to access the link that provided in an attempt to present their case my understanding is that the policy applies to the use of the seal by members of the university community and not an outside non for profit foundation. Once again there has been no violation of the fair use policy concerning the Washington University seal brought to my attention and 87 Atherefore I continue reverting to the original article until one such violation is identified. user please post Washington University seal policy in full on the talk page so users can examine it and compare it to other university policies as I said before I was unable to access the link, you still not be removing the seal PLEASE stop. I do agree with that Fair Use doctrine permits use of the seal in such a not-for-profit context. (As a sidenote, Wikipedia's image tag for """"logos,"""" which asserts the right to use such images in this context, surely wasn't invented out of thin air; there's presumably some legal research/knowledge behind that tag's invention.) I think we might do well soliciting the advice of an administrator who has specific experience in copyright/Fair-Use issues, if this dispute continues. Surely this sort of issue must pop up on Wikipedia all the time. The official seal of the University is a protected trademark and may not be used without the written permission of the University.

""" Well, dear Ahasuerus: It is actually difficult to edit any page in Wikipedia without Muslims jumping at you and trying to censor you with all sorts of excuses. You must understand that the freedom of speech for Muslims is an alien concept. In Islamic countries if you say something against Islam they kill you. Where they can't kill you, they censor you. Wikipedia seems to be dominated by Muslims. This of course is not true in all the pages where Muslims have no interest, but when the interest of Islam comes in, they can be quite bullish in making their word prevail. But that is another story. This article started with some explanation like this: In recent years especially after the 9/11 some observers, including Muslim dissidents have stated that Islam presents a threat bigger than Nazism not to just the Western world but to all non-Islamic countries. They have labeled those who defend Islam and try to be politically correct about it, the today’s useful idiots. [Ali Sina] states: “They are idiots because they speak without knowledge of Islam and its threat to mankind and they are useful to the Islamists with whose help they can penetrate the non-Muslim countries and destroy them from within.” The same author writes: “More abhorrent than war is making peace with evil. In the words of the 18th Century British parliamentarian Edmund Burke, """"All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing."""" Those who advocate peace with Islam are idiots of this century. If we do not stand against Islam it will grow and then billions will die. Trying to appease Muslims is foolish. It is informed by ignorance of Islam. Most cancers are treatable, if detected in time. But if ignored, they will grow to a stage that will kill you. Today we have the choice. We can either fight Islam and extirpate it before it threatens our existence or wait and face the apocalypses.” Muslims obviously don't like Ali Sina. For some reason anything you post here from him they will delete at once. So the above passage that explained the concept was deleted. The administrator SlimVirgin despite claiming impartiality, has yet to show that in actions. I could be wrong but for reasons that I explained to her, I have still to be convinced of that claim. I found out that she is Iranian, like Ali Sina, but of course most Iranians are still Muslims. She even once tried to discredit Ali Sina saying that he is Islamophobic. Obviously she sees genuine criticism of Islam unwarranted and interprets that as Islamophobia. My judgement about her is just based on my first impression and I could be wrong. I have explained to her my concern about her impartiality already and I hope she will eventually show I had misjudged her. In Wikipedia there is a lot of Islamic propaganda which are not true at all, but generally critical views about Islam do not survive. Why? If Wikipedia is impartial shouldn’t we give equal space to both sides? Would we accept if e.g. scientologist or any other cultists try to take over the Wikipedia and disallow any criticism of their cult? What is happening is very disturbing. There are hundreds of pages in Wikipedia that are misleading because they are edited and controlled by Muslims and as soon as you try to post anything showing the other side of the coin they revert it and even call your contribution “hate speech”. What about the Quran? Isn’t that book a hate speech? Funny thing is that they throw at you the basic rules of Wikipedia when in reality it is they who constanly breach those rules. If you try to write anything that Muslims don’t like they will delete it with invalid justifications. This is a very disturbing trend. For example the quotes of Ali Sina were removed because, as they said, he is not notable. There are 200,000 pages talking about faith freedom international. There have been death threats in Islamic sites against him, there are a few Islamic sites created just to refute him. Doesn’t all that say that he is notable at least to be quoted? Finally if he is notable enough to have a page in Wikipedia why his quotes should not be published? I am not familiar with the structure of Wikipedia, but I suppose there must be some committee that would check into complaints. (All I am hoping is that this committee is not already taken over by Islamists) Is there a forum where important questions such as the direction Wikipedia is taking is discussed? Sorry, this subject might have not belonged to this page but these are things I would like to discuss. Is there a place to do that? My point is that if Wikipedia loses its impartiality and becomes the guardian angel of a certain cult or religion, it loses its credibility fast. 05:13 2",0,0,0,0,0,1

", 16 June 2012 (UTC) I've had enough of this for a while. It's like a game for some of you. I love Wikipedia but the guards need guarding a bit I reckon. New editors need training and testing before they can edit, and should have to sign a pledge to be apolitical and impersonal - some old hands get very personal then throw up their hands when others respond. You should check how many times an editor cries for someone to be blocked and see if a pattern emerges. If they persistently ask for blocks the problem probably lies with them.

So I really don't see any reason for removal except some kind of WP:IDON'TLIKEIT With regard to the side bar - the underlying problem is that the very subject of this article, """"Dhimmitude"""" is a POV-loaded term itself, usually used by people with a particular ideology. Part of that ideology/POV is the view that Muslims always and everywhere discriminate against non-Muslims and that this discrimination is captured by this term. But once again - this is just a POV of a particular ideology. If this sidebar was text we could properly attribute it (so and so says that Dhimmitude reflects discrimination etc.) But with a sidebar we cannot do this. Since we cannot properly attribute a sidebar the only recourse is simply to remove it. This is the same as if someone tried to put an """"Apartheid"""" side bar in the article on Israel or something - it'd be POV, just like it is here.

""" I'll go ahead and do the page move. I'll probably wait till tomorrow my Internet time is drawing to a close, and since I haven't done hatnotes very often, I'll want some time to read up on them and correct any mistakes that I make. Regarding references, I don't think you need to include a citation after every sentence, as long as they're not direct or indirect quotes, and/or potentially controversial in any way. This is especially true if a whole paragraph comes from a single source in that case, I just put a single citation marker at the end of the paragraph. If I use multiple sources in a paragraph, but I don't quote anybody or include anything that might come into dispute, I usually stick a string of citations at the end of the paragraph. To me, that makes the text a little more readable. Also regarding citations, you can save yourself a few keystrokes on repeated citations where you're using a name. Once you've created a citation with a name, you don't have to type """"""""; you can just use """""""", with the slash at the end of the tag. That'll give you a tiny bit less keyboarding to do, and it also makes it a little easier to edit when there's a string of citations less risk of losing the closing """""""" tag. I've done this with the Lt. Cherry article, if you'd like to check it out. If you want to get a little fancier, I like to use list-defined references, which is what I did with Lt. Cherry's article. Basically, that involves putting the citation information inside the {{Reflist}} in the references section. That way, it doesn't get eliminated by accident if somebody edits out a passage including citation information and doesn't check the edit summary to make sure that they're not orphaning a """""""" tag. It's also easier to read the text in the edit window if you don't have to wade through tangles of citation details. By the """"Ft. Table"""", did you mean the boxed business in the upper right? In Wikiparlance, that's known as an infobox, and you put them in using templates. The one you'd probably want to use for Ft. Niobrara is Template:Infobox military installation. If you'll follow that Wikilink, you can see how it works. You don't have to fill in all the parameters on an infobox if some of them aren't applicable or if you don't have the information, you can leave them blank. Good luck with the Ft.

No such thing happened with Zeno's edits and for lack of time I reverted to the less horrible version."""" , it's not true that I have not discussed my edits. Nor have I made a large change to the article - I have concentrating on one sub-section of the article, and I have concentrated on a small number of facts regarding the treatment of POWs: i.e. the facts that they may be executed, enslaved for labor or sex, ransomed, or freed. These four options in Islamic law concerning POWs are well-known amongst academics and scholars, as my sources have proven. So my edits have not been making any large structural changes to the article, I have concentrated on one sub-section and have elaborated on these four facts. And, as I said, I did discuss these edits, contrary to your allegation. I had been discussing the POW section for several days before I made my recent edit. On July 19, you made this allegation that I have not discussed my edits to the POW section. The truth is that I started discussing the POW section 10 days ago, on July 10, when I started the section Talk:Jihad#Heraclius.27_Mass_Reversion_War. The issue was subsequently discussed in three lengthy sections of this discussion page, before you made this allegation. I had been discussing the POW section here for 10 days, and yet you said that I did not discuss it at all. This is therefore a false allegation on your part. Please follow the discussion page more closely if you are going to talk about who has been discussing what and since when. Once you are at wikiepdia for long enough you tool will probably get sick of the same type of narrow-sighted edits that continually happen by new users. I'm not sure who or what you are talking about. If you believe that my edit on the POW section was narrow-sighted, then please explain why - enlighten us with your apparently wide-sighted perspective. """"Maybe this is just me but it seems that ahistorical apologetics are much less dangerous than wholescale demonization and editting articles to say """"Islam says X thing that modern western society doesn't accept. Clearly, neither are very good ways to write an article but the latter has more of an agenda and is usually from the type that end up calling Zora or dab or I Muslims."""" Again, I am not sure who or what you are talking about. I certainly have not denounced anyone's views just because they are Muslims. On the contrary, I have said before that I wish there were more Muslims editing this article so that a wider Muslim view could represented than the one that is currently represented by the """"ahistorical apologetics"""" as you call them. Having said that, I strongly disagree with your opinion that no one on Wikipedia should describe any Islamic practices or laws that modern society Western does not accept. We must inevitably discuss what """"Islam says"""" about various subjects. We must report the objective facts about traditional Islamic beliefs, in a neutral fashion. Neutrality does not mean that if some traditional belief disagrees with the values of modern Western society then it must be not be mentioned. You seem to be advocating ahistorical apologetics over neutral and objective facts. You have not disproven any of my claims about POWs and Islam, but you have insisted that these objective facts are somehow """"dangerous."""" As for your allegations of """"wholesale demonization,"""" they are unwarrented. The way that Islam treats prisoners of war is completely in line with the norms of the medieval era, during which these practicies were codified. It is a fact of life that Islamic beliefs are deeply rooted in the past, and as a result they are sometimes in disagreement with modern, secular humanist values. If you were truly neutral about this subject, then you would not object to the reporting of facts just because the demonstrate a disagreement between traditional Islam and modern, secular humanist values. It would be the pinnacle of POV pushing if the article were nothing more than ahistorical appolgetics that ommit any and all facts which demonstrate that traditional Islam is at odds with modern secular humanism.

"There are 34 references in Michael Aldrich - 17 are from the Archive, 4 are from reputable broadsheets, 3 are from peer reviewed publications, 4 are UK Government reports, 4 are books, 1 is a City government website and 1 is a University Art Gallery. The reverted edits fromOnline Shopping and Electronic Commerce which cover the four central claims have those references you quote. The newspaper cuttings can be found in date order at Press Cuttings, Aldrich Archive, University of Brighton. There are no paqe numbers. In the Michael Aldrich article other references are also used. There are three central claims - he invented an online shopping system[he actually claims to have invented online shopping, which I left for peer review],Thomson Holidays 1981 was the first recorded B2B and Gateshead SIS/Tesco was the first B2C with the world's first recorded online shopper. For the first claim I found 4 sources in the Press Cuttings plus of course Aldrich's own claims. For the second there are also 4 sources, one peer reviewed. For the third, there is a peer reviewed source and a TV interview by Lawrence McGinty, an acclaimed UK science reporter, broadcast on Independent Television News in the UK in 1984. In looking at the sources common-sense is needed. Aldrich's teleshopping systems received a very sceptical welcome. HiFi systems were the big news in 1980. Many reports of his new system are wonderfully garbled and a little silly. Few understood what he was talking about. Online shopping did not exist. I experimented with a 14 year old, a fifteen year old and a 64 year old professor to test your objections to the references.

You have been pointed to problematic material in the article several times. It appears as if every time problematic material is pointed out, it is completely ignored. Please note that maintenance tags, and this quality assessment, exist in an attempt to draw editors from the Wikipedia community who will help in improving the article. The whole point in these tags is to make the article better by advertising it within Wikipedia, to get experienced editors to take part in the struggle for a better article which conforms to Wikipedia guidelines and standards. I assume that you are in favor of making the article better, as it seems that the article and the subject are very dear to you, which is why I ask you not to remove maintenance and quality tags unless the community decides to remove them. I believe there is general agreement that the article in its current state is of poor quality, although there are disagreements about how it would look better. Due to that and due to my assumption that you want the article to become better, and fit Wikipedia guidelines which is a necessity for featured articles, I ask you to replace the quality rating and replace whatever maintenance tags you removed against mutual editors' agreement. 109.186.10.101",0,0,0,0,0,0

I looked and the article I cited said they were neck and neck. OK, my reasoning on the cnn article was probably weak, but it still may be true. Bluray's website claims to have passed hd dvd, but I doubt that that is a very reliable place to look for info. Can someone find something else or revert it back? (I don't know how to do that) HD-DVD has the backing of the porn industry, so its practically won already. Blu Ray fanboy stay out Some people keep changing articles with no proof. Stop it. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by (talk • contribs) .

The source reads: """"The European Union has just ratified a law “banning incitement to or denial of genocide” (arguably including both the Holocaust and the Armenian genocide)."""" Some enthusiasts removed the word arguably when citing the source. Let's have a look at the law itself. Framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia Official Press Release Certain forms of conduct as outlined below, which are committed for a racist or xenophobic purpose, are punishable as criminal offences: ... public condoning, denying or grossly trivialising crimes of genocide ... as defined in the Statute of the International Criminal Court (Articles 6, 7 and 8) and crimes defined in Article 6 of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal, when the conduct is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred against such a group or a member of such a group. Example: Somebody publicly claims that an act of genocide, the commission of which has been established as a fact by an international court, never happened and was invented by the ethnic group concerned solely for the purpose of being able to claim compensation payments. This allegation would not only deny the genocide committed against the ethnic group concerned, but would also incite hatred against this group. In the future, all Member States would be compelled to criminalise such a case. Whether a specific historical crime falls within these definitions must be decided in each concrete case by the court which has jurisdiction. In the case of the Holocaust, for example, this was done by the Nuremberg Tribunal. As we see, the law is restricted to cases, when: the commission of genocide is established by an international court and the denial is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred Is the commission of Armenian genocide established by an international court?

I'm glad to see them, and I'm sorry I didn't spot them before I left my earlier message. I'd like to try to address some of those concerns. If I'm not mistaken (and please correct me if I am), this seems to be your core concern: """"I believe it is confusing to a person searching for that name to find another name."""" You might be unaware of this, but Wikipedia has a """"redirect"""" feature that can take a commonly used search term and re-point it to the article it refers to, if that article exists under a different name. You can try this: type """"The Wild Center"""" into Wikipedia's search box; it should take you to the Natural History Museum of the Adirondacks article. From a reader's perspective, the redirect does have the potential to be confusing: """"I typed in one thing, and the big headline at the article says something completely different!"""" Naturally we don't want such confusion. There are two things that can help. One is that Wikipedia will show a little message saying """"(Redirected from The Wild Center)"""" so the user at least knows they didn't somehow hit the """"Random article"""" link or something like that. Another one that the editors of the target article can do is to make sure the common search terms are mentioned. In this case, the article's lead sentence highlights this by introducing """"The Wild Center"""" as an alternative name, and it's in boldface so it's harder to miss. A person searching on """"The Wild Center"""" and arriving at the Natural History Museum of the Adirondacks article will probably not be very confused, since they'll see """"The Wild Center"""" prominently displayed on the page, and since they'll more than likely already know that The Wild Center is a museum of natural history located in the Adirondacks, so the full official name is unlikely to surprise them. You also say """"I think that the Museum has the right to choose its own name."""" I don't think anyone would disagree with that, but it's reasonable to think that the nickname """"The Wild Center"""" could be in vogue for a few years and then replaced by another nickname. (""""The Otter Stop"""", perhaps? ) If there's a stable, official name that will stick with it for as long as it's a museum, it makes some sense to use that name for the article title and to set up redirects for all of the popular nicknames. The purpose of Wikipedia is not to aid the museum in marketing itself, but it's definitely reasonable to adopt some of the marketing phrases if that's how a significant number of people might identify the place.

"""Update: The Oreskes abstracts Naomi Oreskes claims to have analysed 928 abstracts she found listed on the ISI Web of Knowledge database (1993 – 2003) using the keywords """"global climate change."""" However, this claim is incorrect: while the ISI database includes a total of 929 documents for the period in question, it lists only 905 abstracts. It is thus impossible that Oreskes analysed 928 abstracts. In my original critique, I used the same ISI database and the same key words as Oreskes but used all documents listed therein. While Oreskes did not specify the method she applied in her study, she later confirmed that she had limited her search to “articles”, while I included “all document types” in my initial assessment. This difference appears to explain the discrepancy between the “928” abstracts Oreskes claims to have analysed and the 1117 documents I found and considered, although her figures don’t add up, one way or another. Some commentators have argued that these differences undermine my main criticism while they validate Oreskes' claim. However, as I have stressed repeatedly, Oreskes entire argument is flawed as the whole ISI data set includes just 13 abstracts (less than 2%) that explicitly endorse what she has called the 'consensus view.' In fact, the vast majority of abstracts do not mention anthropogenic climate change. I have posted all documents and abstracts listed in the ISI database under the key words “global climate change” (for the period 1993 – 2003) below, arranged by year. Check for yourself!

"March 2009 (UTC) An event horizon is any surface from beyond which no information can ever reach the observer. Of course, that includes objects of all kinds - in fact, anything moving at or below the speed of light - so in a sense you're right. An important thing to note though is that the event horizon - in the strictest sense - belongs to the observer, rather than the thing (not) being observed. In the case of a black hole, the event horizon is the same for all outside observers, which I guess is what you mean by a 'physical boundary'. The Event horizon article is biased towards this, the most commonly encountered form of event horizon. The cosmological event horizon is different: since every point in the Universe is receding from every other point with a speed proportional to distance, the event horizon is always a sphere centred on a particular observer, so there is no single 'event horizon of the Universe' (although of course we tend to give a special place to our own event horizon).

""" Kung Moggy If we're listing fictional martial arts forms, under Television there should be an entry for """"kung moggy"""", the martial art that Ernest Penfold, of the Danger Mouse TV Show, claims to be an aexpert of. — Preceding unsigned comment added by (talk • contribs) Tae Kwon Do Are you sure we can't move Tae Kwon Do to this page? Maybe at least to a sports sections? How clearly can it be described when it's named Korea's National Sport? Heh' Yeah I'm only half serious Tae Kwon Do is inspired by the conbination of Karate and Judo and practiced by real people, so its history is very similiar to Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do. Hence it is an actual martial art. To those of you who think Tae Kwon Do should belong to this page, read up on its history. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 150.216.217.239 Moving Teras Kasi from """"Movies and Television"""" to """"Games"""" Though the game Masters of Teräs Käsi is set in the Star Wars universe, the fighting style exists only in video games, namely Masters as well as Star Wars: Galaxies. It has never been mentioned in the movies, and is not part of the canon. I propose that this entry be moved to the games section. Teras Kasi is also part of several Star Wars novels written by Steve Perry. So it is not just used in games, it is is also used in several of Steve Parry's star wars novels. JJL, 23 November 2005 Tai Shing Pek Kwar is a real style of monkey kung fu, not (or in addition to?) a fictional one. It's the style of Paulie Zink. Does it belong here? On Taejutsu, it was not invented by Seth McFarlane for """"Family Guy"""", although he might have thought so at the time. Taejutsu is actually the name of the unarmed fighting style which is part of Ninjutsu. See any book by Stephen K. Hayes. Thats Taijutsu, different spelling. Also I second the moving the Teras Kasi thing, never been in or near the movies, and I don't believe that it does have any relation or connection to the the Force, the article on it certainly says nothing about that. Lastly is Fuck You not infact a joke Mike Myers said in So I Married An Axe Murderer, not a fictional martial art from that movie? Miss Ho style While drunken boxing is real, the drunken Miss Ho style Wong Fei Hong makes up is not. Miss Ho is one of the eight drunken immortals of legend, and her movements are part of the Eight Immortals Style, as well as other forms of Drunken Boxing. Also, wouldn't lightsaber fighting be broken up into the dark side and the light side? In fact, it is mentioned in canon resources that there are seven traditional lightsaber fighting styles (or, they are mentioned up through seven), though their exploration is done entirely in non-canon. Naruto What about adding the martial arts from Naruto? Tekken Taijutsu (with its swirling leaf attacks and inner gate openings), Jyuken Taijutsu with its Dim Mak-ness, etc. CQC I've seen references and articles that state that CQC is a real combat system and the MSG3 CQC style is simply a version with a alternative history and modified for gameplay. Not really a fictional MA. Someone should check this out. I believe CQC is real only because I saw it on many websites describing it's origin (all are the same), The history channel, and...wikipedia >_> I'll just go ahead and remove CQC from the list. """"CQC"""" is an acronym for """"Close Quarters Combat"""". It's just a generic term for armed and unarmed close combat tactics, not a specific art, although there are several military and paramilitary organizations that use it to refer to their hand-to-hand training systems.

""" How much money was exchanged for this interview? And was this interview constructed to conflict prison officer Pascoe's claim that he fired a shot that killed Hodson? In the opinion of this nun, Ryan no longer wanted to live. But this nun was not a psychologist, so how could she possibly come to that conclusion? Obviously, it seems Ryan's execution was more of a state-assisted suicide. In relation to this alleged confession, Ryan didn't actually say he shot Hodson, but allegedly, said he shot to wing not to kill. Ryan, obviously in an extremely confused mental state, (as any person would be prior to being killed by the Government), could have been talking about his past kangaroo shooting events or any other event for that matter. After all, a mentally confused person does not talk in a rational manner. Besides, nobody else close to Ryan claimed he no longer wanted to live. None of Ryan's family members claim he said such a thing. In any case, any person who states they no longer wish to live should be immediately evaluated for mental illness, So, why wasn't a psychiatrist called to treat Ryan for possible mental disorders, depression and suicidal thoughts? Why the push to execute Ryan if he was mentally unstable, hence, no longer wanted to live? Legal professionals will confirm that alleged confessions and alleged verbals are not legally acceptable as """"evidence of guilt"""". Many prisoners have been later aquitted of murder after allegations of verbals and confessions. There must be scientific forensic evidence to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. In Ryan's case there was none - nothing! To make aftermath allegations against Ryan, decades after his execution when he cannot defend himself, are vile, immoral, unethical and complete mockery to the justice system, to the dead Ryan, and to his innocent family members. The police corruption uncovered by various Australian Royal Commissions is enough to question the validity of Ryan's alleged verbals. Why would Ryan make all these alleged confessions, then in the eleventh-hour write to various people; I state most emphatically that I am not guilty of murder"""" In addition, Father Brosnan put an end to all these aftermath unproven and unconfirmed allegations in February 2003, when he was interviewed on ABC National Radio, shortly before his death.

"Brews, the rotating identical spheres makes a good action-reaction pair example. We'll begin with the general radial equation as it applies to sphere A, Applied centripetal force + induced centrifugal force = m were r is the radius. Since the string joining the spheres is not changing in length, then m will be equal to zero and so the centrifugal force outwards on sphere A will be equal to the centripetal force inwards on sphere A, which is given by tension T. Hence T = mv^2/r which equals both the centrifugal force and the centripetal force. Every force acting on sphere A will have an equal and opposite force acting on sphere B. Hence the centripetal force (-T) acting on sphere B could be considered as a reactive centrifugal force from the perspective of sphere A. This example is OK, but because it is circular, it masks the general picture.

"Morgause's Parents It was recently learned that she has a half sister, Morgause, who was smuggled out of Camelot by Gaius at her birth, and it was revealed by Gaius that she is the daughter of Gorlois. The identity of her mother remains unknown. We can't know Gorlois is Morgause's father for sure, just from the crest she wore and in fact it seems like its the other way around, from recent events. Helen (I believe is her name?), Gorlois' wife, seems to be the shared parent of Morgana and Morgause. Spoilers for 3x05, if you haven't seen: If Morgana and Morgause share a father, why did Morgana continue to call Morgause 'sister' after revealing to Morgause that Uther was her father? They would be entirely unrelated if Gorlois was not Morgana's father. And you would think the subject would have come up. Also, the way Morgause mentioned that the healing bracelet she gave Morgana was 'a gift from her mother' seems to imply more that they share a mother and not a father.",0,0,0,0,0,0

I really need to understand how this can be seen as an example of """" Extremist-style one way traffic"""".

It is a wind up, and you having warned me of windups should know better. Please do walk the talk.

So it would seem that someone who cannot read is busy worrying about the counting ability of another.And this issue was discussed last year, the time to respond was then, at that time you were also asked direct questions by me, which you chose to ignore. And that an arbcom member is so bent of fighting with a mere editor and besmirching him must be also a source of great pride for some. I have not commented on your religion or your country, you have on mine. Shows who has attacked people based on national identities or religion. So that too must make someone very proud. Defending a person, or standing up for them does not mean one agrees with every statement that they may have made. Show me where I have defended Bhaisaab's anti religion comments. So you have now made another false claim above that I defend anti semetic speech. By the same generalisation what would you say about an admin not even reacting to an virulent anti Muslim speech made by his protege, even after I posted it on the admin's talk page ? Further that admin's defending his protege then makes the admin (by your logic above) a defender of anti Muslim speech!. That I an editor with no powers is fighting a biased and prejudiced person, misusing his position , is a great source of pride for me. Also please do note that since the arbcom elections I have not bothered to be involved with you, till you went about posting details about me;and your attempt to trace my location , to an editor hostile to me.

"You got what had been coming to you. I hope that being a k3wL eleet nerd-o-pedia moderator has made your life hell. - From someone that you totally wronged with your bullshit and managed to get me to stop contributing very significant contributions to this site nearly a year ago now. (And I contributed a LOT in a short time and would have contributed SO much more had I continued. Things that I did: huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free (placed PD) on subjects (often providing the only pics, to this day, on the subjects in question), hundreds of pages formatted according to standards, huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected (in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it) etc. etc.) - and instead of helping me and being civil, sensible and using common sense YOU were more interested in defending a non-contributing user who (for no apparent reason) started a campaign of open violent threats, death threats, spamming and vandalism on me. You were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me, trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation, by mod-vandalizing discussions on the subject etc. - against most other moderators (private) views even - they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject. Your 500 page nerd-o-pedia rule-book and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you. Apparently you felt that since you had read it, everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter, or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didn't - with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it, no regard for that individuals contributions, no regard for civility - and most of all, with no common sense applied whatsoever. It's indeed too bad that most pages on nerd-o-pedia are starting to be shockingy un-maintained and obsolete, indeed dead now that the initial rush of contributors is over after a few years, and the fun is over for most people - as, the most brutal blow of all, moderators such as YOU have managed to destroy the morale of even the most serious contributors and have had them leave. They simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior, because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here, because of people like YOU, and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here. It's all about brown-nosing with the crowd and building your giant online virtual ego and lick the ass of other even more OCD nerds who are already admins, and you're just a wannabe. Good ****ing luck trying to get anything edited or updated here in a year or two besides top 10 whatever pop bands may be popular at the time, the latest tv show pages and some other obsessive-compulsive nerdishm. Nobody is foolish enough to put up with the crap that comes along with the job, from people such as YOU. For example, the pages on my subjects were very active till late 2006, and since that they have... well. Remained in the same form as the core contributors left them, as they left this site. No updates. I'm truly not the only one to eject. Not worth the effort to contribute when all you get is shitted all over, if you ever need any help. It's kind of funny that an admin can burn out of this site too, but given your attitude back then, I'm not surprised you did. After all, there were some decent admins here back then (such as ), and I'm sure there's a few now, but WAY too many nerds for whom it is the biggest thing of their lives, and they have to show it, and snoop their noses everywhere. But like I said, as even admins are dropping out, what do you think happened to the contributors?

"Another Explanation of the Error Before we open any envelopes, it doesn't seem unreasonable to assume that if the envelopes are said contain A and 2A (without distinguishing which envelope contains which amount), then all values of A are equally likely − because we have no better information. However, it does not then follow from this assumption that, given A is found in the first envelope, the other envelope is equally likely to contain (1/2)A or 2A for every conceivable value of A (which is something we have implied in the subsequent calculation of expected value). Why? Because, for any specific amount of money from which to fill the envelopes, given we have found A in the first envelope, for all values of A we can always find (1/2)A in the second envelope, whereas it is only possible to find 2A in the second envelope half the time. See it like this: If the specific amount of money is M say, then we can find A to have any value up to (2/3)M, but the second envelope can only contain 2A for values of A up to (1/3)M ie. half as often. So, given A was found in the first envelope, the chance of finding (1/2)A in the second envelope is 2/3, and the chance of having 2A in the second envelope is 1/3 − not equal as we had assumed, even though all values of A are still being assumed to be equally likely.",0,0,0,0,0,0

""" Newly published source Source Paths to conflagration fifty years of diplomacy and warfare in Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, 1778-1828. Authors: Mayurī Ngaosīvat [Mayuri Ngaosivat]and Pheuiphanh Ngaosyvathn. Publisher: Ithaca, N.Y. Southeast Asia Program Publications, Cornell University, 1998. Series: Studies on Southeast Asia, no. 24. Edition/Format: Book English. ID Numbers: Open Library OL433527M | ISBN 10 0877277230 | LC Control Number 98141866 | OCLC/WorldCat 38909607 | Library Thing 4223523 Review With this work, the authors, Mayoury and Pheuiphanh Ngaosyvathn, offer us a wealth of information on the history of a small kingdom, the Lao, centered at Vientiane, in modern Laos, caught between expanding core states (Burma, Thailand, and Vietnam) in the late eighteenth- and early nineteenth century. The authors draw upon a wide literature and an impressive range of languages to present a clear and careful picture of a very complex period in Lao and Southeast Asian history. This book is really the story of Chou Anou, the last of the Lao kings of Vientiane and his struggle against rivals on all sides. Chou Anou played a political game between the expansionist Thai and Vietnamese states in the late eighteenth and ear]y nineteenth centuries, a game that his kingdom eventually lost. Because of the Tay Son, Vietnam was out of the picture for decades; the central Thai court was Chou Anou's chief antagonist. When Vietnam does enter the picture again under Minh Mang, it is as a supporter of Chou Anou, in the context of a larger Thai-Vietnamese competitive hostility. Fighting between Thailand and Vientiane appears on an extremely personal level in the text — the authors stressing at one point Rama III's anxiety that a massacre of Vietnamese emissaries and Lao guides by a Thai officer had not left enough dead, considering an earlier massacre of Thai by Chou Anou in Vientiane (p. 242); they stress also the personal nature of the fighting between Chou Anou and the Thai general Bodin. Further, the text seems almost to replicate, anachronistically, aspects of war more endemic to the post-World-War II conflicts in Indochina, including a reference to """"sophisticated Siamese psychological operations"""" (p. 212). Paths to Conflagration is organized into nine chapters, each covering a different episode of the period, examined step-by-step, and turns from one incarnation of Vientiane to another — from victim to provocateur to buffer state. Each page is heavy with documentation, but the narrative is lighter. This book has three real strengths. First, it discusses history at the point of intersection between three different polities and does not apply the nation-state """"cookie-cutter"""" approach — looking only at developments as they relate to a state-centered narrative (thus framed by political borders). Instead of the history of Laos, we find here the history of a very turbulent period in which political borders did not mean very much in delineating the boundaries of action. Second, this book makes use of a very wide range of sources, especially from the Thai archives, spanning a large number of languages (including Lao, Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, French, English, and German — both primary sources and secondary literature) and a multitude of perspectives. Third, this book focuses attention on developments sometimes left out of analyses of mainland Southeast Asian history, such as the all-important impact of migration, especially in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It is no mistake that migration is referred to over and over again in chronicles of the period, from western Burma to Vietnam, and that migration is used as metaphor for political change and state reformation for far earlier periods in these chronicles. Here too, migration played a very important role, as the authors stress both migration into the Lao kingdom, and forcible expulsion by the Thais, as a basis for the well-being and even survival of the Vientiane-based state.

""":Yeah, there is an article about that in Wiki too:Pre-Greek substrate. The -ulis suffix however poses no problem to include it as an IE suffix, you will find such suffixes throughout IE and they are traced back to PIE (Latin -ula, Alb. -ullë, Greek -ule (kotyla), in Slavic there is proto-Slavic *sedulo, Germanic *sadulaz (>English saddle) etc. etc. In Greek -ulis does not appear to be that common, but -ule (arbule) is common enough. If someone were to collect all the -ulis examples in Greek, you probably won't find any indication of a pre-IE origin for it, and even a Thracian or Illyrian origin may not fit the data. It's probably native to Greek or some Greek dialects. In the case of bombylis and arbylis, bomb- here means """"bubble"""" or some such (Greek pomphos, """"bubble""""), and such forms are found in IE (French pompon of obscure origin) & non-IE I think, while arb- (meaning """"curved"""", """"arched""""?) may also be IE, I just haven't checked yet.

""" Comment I have stayed away from this discussion for a couple of days, minded to retire from Wikipedia. I'll postpone that idea a while. There is an important issue here. Does anyone wonder why this page suddenly became the focus of attention? From 2003 until July 17 2011 the length of this talk page grew to 17,726 bytes. Since August 29 it has grown by 74,997 bytes (before this post). Meanwhile the List of castles in Wales remains rather neglected, and there is no sign of new individual county pages of castles in England getting extra attention. A glance up this talk page to see what was written here before August 29 2011 will reveal unfailingly polite discussion. Here is a sample of what has been written recently: """"The professional attitude towards the current article has been lost to ego... As this is a shameful topic opened by Paravane... Paravane, you are ignorant and I'm tired of your possessive behaviour, against ownership guidelines... Clearly you are not competent in terms of reasonably developing an article to support the wider community... This article is a sham - a bloated mess, with weak keys, many images, and shoddy management. You have done nothing in terms of AGF of those making edits, or suggestions and continue to pursue your own mis-guided approach... As for FLC - they wouldn't touch this with a barge pole... splitting... removes the current possessive ownership attitudes which haunt the article..."""" Two points in particular deserve consideration: Some editors, faced with what appears very plainly to be a personal campaign against them, will opt to retire from Wikipedia, and especially if personal attacks are seen to achieve their purpose. If reason is not the sole - or even the principal - mechanism of advancing a campaign, it cannot be depended upon that reason will ever be sufficient to counter it. If the campaign is obsessive, every line of reasoning will be dismissed by every possible means, and the campaign may be carried for no better reason than its opponents weary of arguing. A practice of ignoring the breakdown of mutual respect, as a basis for cooperation in the community, can hardly fail to be damaging to Wikipedia. """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I have put a footnote at the bottom of the chart which says something along the lines of 'every week highest male, female and next highest advanced. Every week, 2 males advanced however it was never revealed which male was the highest and which male won the non-gender specific slot'... Because of this I have replaced 'adv' with 'Top 2' in the cyan colour for male contestants and 'Top' in pink for the female contestants that were non wild-card as we know that they were the highest female vote getters. This new format makes the chart much more correct especially with the footnote at the bottom.",0,0,0,0,0,0

""" I shall ignore your stupid personal insults. My mention of """"only 15 years"""" was not in any way to defend any such policy, but merely to point out how different that is from the impression you initially gave, with your """"long history"""" introduction and no mention of 1945, that this policy had been there for centuries and might still be in force. Without looking any further, this impression is obviously disproven by the fact that Ayer himself was at Eton, which is why I pointed that out. Of course I am aware that he was there long before 1945. I have never doubted that there was antisemitic feeling at Eton, as was generally the case among some or all of the English upper classes, and I said so at the outset, and that is reflected in the revised opening that I have put on the paragraph, """"In the past, Eton has been guilty of antisemitism, like English society generally"""". This sets the matter properly in context. The bald assertion in the Tablet article """"Eton (....) required that its students' fathers be British by birth, so as to keep out the Jews"""" on which you based your initial intervention, proves to be without justification, as I said all along, and as you now seem to be admitting. And yes, I do think you should amend the article to make it clear that any anti-Jewish policy applied only to King's Scholars. It's not that that makes it any better (I never said any of this was good), just that it is misleading not to include that qualification. As for the idea that Eton is precious to me, anyone who knows my personal views about the English class system and private education will find that extremely hilarious. You should not make such silly assumptions. I already said that I hold no brief for Eton. I am simply concerned that the article be accurate. My personal opinions (which happen to be leftwing and pro-Jewish) have nothing to do with it. It is a requirement for editing Wikipedia that one leaves one's own point of view at the door.

"(A) Yes it's early. And the timing might be a coincidence. But until there is contrary evidence, the timing says all to me.....

The deal was sealed when an official ARBCC notice went on their talk page a couple hours later. They've been silent ever since. There could be another explanation, but per Occam's Razor I will need other evidence to think the ANI I filed was not the determining factor. (B)As for consensus, that certainly applies to discussions of sources and text. Only JJ was (needlessly) agreeing with the assessment that another editor is too uneducated on the issue to contribute.

"Ed, I am tired! Anyway, I certainly did not mean to trivialize the suffering of vicitms of racism, only to say that most scientists racist and anti-racist have not been persecuted the way Galileo was. Perhaps racist scientists should be. But even here I would qualify it not only do I not want to put some racist scientists in the US or Canada in the same category of Joseph Mengele, I think the crucial difference is precisely the social context we live in a society based on free debate where a few scientists can be racist and they will be challenged publically and a well-informed public can make up its mind. In the 1930s racist scientists lived in racist societies, both here and in Germany, and their work was used to justify and promote horrible things. But today such scientists in eitehr the US or Germany can say what they want and for the most part, thanks in part to open scientific debate, and democratic societies where there is vigorous public debate in legislatures, their work has not had the same awful effect.

""":::::: Again, most of that is gibberish to me, but the first place to begin sorting it might be ... I do not know why BogHog changed to vcite or to vcite2 after he took over maintaining the Diberri tool. Nor do I know what that means in every case. The case I know about is that autism used vcite instead of cite because of load time issues (Eubulides developed vcite for that purpose, but Eubulides is gone), and I remember at some point having a conversation with BogHog about the vcite vs vcite2 issues ... but the rest fades in memory. That may or may not mean BogHog explained it all to me once ... and I may or may not have understood at the time. When I use Boghog's new Diberri tool, I edit the output to use the old standard form, for consistency in citation style. And I continue to use the vcite format in the autism suite. That we now have a mix on FAs is because new editors may not always respect CITEVAR, and I may not catch them all. But there was once a clear standard across almost all medical content, and is being systematically deteriorated to an inconsistent style that creates bloat and is hard to edit around.
